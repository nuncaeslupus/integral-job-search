# arsenal_config_test.sh — the model settings, and the table they live in.
#
# Which model runs the orchestrator and which runs the workers used to be a
# model id written into vendored protocol prose, so a consumer who wanted a
# different one had to edit a file the next upgrade overwrites. They are now
# `[models]` in the host-owned arsenal/config.toml.
#
# A TOML table is the first one this config has carried, which brings two
# things worth a test: dotted-key reads (`models.workers`), and the fact that a
# bare key appended after a table header is read as a member OF that table.
# init.py appends `queue-automation` that way, so the workflow opt-out would
# have silently stopped working the moment a repo set a model.
#
# Exit: 0 PASS, 1 FAIL.
