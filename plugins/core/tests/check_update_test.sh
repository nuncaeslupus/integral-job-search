# check_update_test.sh — regression test for the "already current" false
# negative reported by a downstream consumer.
#
# A repo re-vendored the bundle, was told it was current, and ran a whole
# session on a stale copy. Two independent conditions both exited 0 without a
# word: no `arsenal` remote was configured (the bundle had been hand-copied,
# so there was nothing to compare against), and the newer upstream release was
# UNTAGGED (its tag workflow never ran during an Actions outage), so the
# tag-gated check could not see it either. Silence read as "up to date".
#
# Gates:
#   - no remote                         → says the check is inert, exit 0;
#   - newest tag == installed, but the default branch ships a newer
#     .bundle-version                   → names that untagged version;
#   - newest tag < installed            → refuses to downgrade (the old
#     `installed != latest` test would have subtree-merged backwards);
#   - genuinely current                 → says so rather than staying silent;
#   - newest tag > installed            → still takes the update path.
# Exit: 0 on PASS, 1 on FAIL.
