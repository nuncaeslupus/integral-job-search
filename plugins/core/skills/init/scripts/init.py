## Automatic session protocol

Every session, without waiting to be asked:

1. Read `arsenal/session/handover.md` for the previous session's context.
2. List the repository's issues labelled `arsenal:task` — **open and closed** — and
   save the JSON. Use whatever GitHub access this surface has; run
   `claude-arsenal/bin/github_channel.sh --detect` to find out which.
3. Run `python3 claude-arsenal/scripts/query_status.py --issues <that file>` for the
   board, and report anything it flags.
4. Pick up work: `python3 claude-arsenal/scripts/task_select.py --issues <that file>`
   returns the next unblocked task, then
   `bash claude-arsenal/bin/claim_task.sh <id>` takes it (see `@claude-arsenal/AGENTS.md`).
   - **Nothing returned + workspace plans exist** → seed tasks from each plan.
   - **Nothing at all** → ask what to work on.
5. Open each task's PR with `Closes #<issue>` so merging it closes the task by itself.
6. After any session with tasks: update `arsenal/session/handover.md`.

    Installed by default because the whole point is that queue upkeep does not
    depend on anyone remembering it — a workflow a repo has to opt into is one
    more setup step to forget, and the sessions that most need the cleanup are
    the ones that ended badly. But a file that grants itself write access to
    issues and contents should never appear silently, so the first install

    Deleting the file has to be a real opt-out, and that needs a record: the

                               once, and never reinstall.
      * `false`      — opted out. Do nothing, silently. Set the key back to
                       `true` to opt in again.
