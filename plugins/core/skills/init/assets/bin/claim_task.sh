#!/usr/bin/env bash
# claim_task.sh <task-id> — take exclusive ownership of a task, or fail cleanly.
#
# The whole coordination problem reduces to one question: when two sessions
# want the same task, who gets it? Every previous answer here needed a shared
# writable branch, a side worktree, and a sync step to keep two copies of the
# ledger honest — and none of it worked on a sandbox that only lets a session
# push its own working branch.
#
# GitHub already provides the primitive:
#
#     POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/git/refs   →  422 "Reference already exists"
#
# Creating a ref is a compare-and-swap. Exactly one concurrent creator gets
# 201; everyone else gets 422. It is decided server-side, so there is no
# settle interval, no tie-break, and no window where two sessions both believe
# they won. It needs no worktree, no branch switch, and no push — which is why
# it works on every surface.
#
# Two different safety properties, deliberately handled separately:
#
#   * Not taking work a human already holds is a PRECONDITION, not a race —
#     they assigned themselves long before. The caller checks the issue.
#   * Two sessions racing for the same free task is the actual race, and only
#     the claim ref can settle it: every session authenticates as the SAME
#     GitHub identity, so an assignee cannot tell two agents apart.
#
# Stdout:
#   won <ref>            — the claim is yours
#   lost                 — someone else holds it
#   manual <METHOD> <PATH> <BODY>
#                        — no scriptable GitHub channel here; make this exact
#                          call with your built-in GitHub tools and treat
#                          201 as `won`, 422 as `lost`
# Exit: 0 won, 1 lost, 5 manual, 2 error.
