"""arsenal_config.py — read the host-owned `arsenal/config.toml`.

The point of this file is that a consumer configures behaviour **without
editing a skill**. Skills are vendored build output: an upgrade overwrites
them, so a preference stored in one is a preference that silently disappears.
`arsenal/config.toml` is host-owned and upstream never rewrites it.

Every key has a default, so a repo with no config file behaves sensibly and a
repo with a partial file only overrides what it names.

Keys are flat, except that a TOML table reads as dotted keys — `[models]`
with `workers = "sonnet"` is the key `models.workers`. Grouping the model
choices under one header is what lets a consumer state them the way they think
of them, rather than as two unrelated top-level strings.

Usage:
    arsenal_config.py                      # print the effective config as JSON
    arsenal_config.py --get merge-policy   # print one value, bare
    arsenal_config.py --get models.workers # dotted key: a value inside a table
    arsenal_config.py --explain            # show each value and where it came from

Exit: 0 on success, 2 on an invalid value (a typo in a policy name is a
configuration bug worth failing loudly for, not silently defaulting past).
