"""arsenal_config.py — read the host-owned `arsenal/config.toml`.

The point of this file is that a consumer configures behaviour **without
editing a skill**. Skills are vendored build output: an upgrade overwrites
them, so a preference stored in one is a preference that silently disappears.
`arsenal/config.toml` is host-owned and upstream never rewrites it.

Every key has a default, so a repo with no config file behaves sensibly and a
repo with a partial file only overrides what it names.

Usage:
    arsenal_config.py                      # print the effective config as JSON
    arsenal_config.py --get merge-policy   # print one value, bare
    arsenal_config.py --explain            # show each value and where it came from

Exit: 0 on success, 2 on an invalid value (a typo in a policy name is a
configuration bug worth failing loudly for, not silently defaulting past).
