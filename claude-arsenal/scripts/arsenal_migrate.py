"""arsenal_migrate.py — move a repo from the coordination-branch queue to task files.

What changes, and why it is safe to run:

* `claude-arsenal/queue/tasks.jsonl` + `<id>.md` payloads  →  `arsenal/tasks/<id>.md`,
  one file per task, front matter carrying the fields the selector needs and
  the payload kept as the body. Task ids are preserved so `deps` keep resolving.
* `claude-arsenal/session/` and `claude-arsenal/project/`  →  `arsenal/`,
  because host-owned state living inside the vendored prefix is what stopped
  the bundle being consumable as a subtree.
* `arsenal/config.toml` is created if absent.

Tasks in a terminal state are **not** recreated as work — they are recorded in
`arsenal/tasks/_migrated-history.md` so the record survives without
resurrecting finished tasks into the queue.

Nothing is deleted. The coordination branch and its worktree are reported for
you to remove by hand, because a sandboxed session cannot delete refs and a
half-done automatic cleanup is worse than an explicit instruction.

Runs read-only by default — pass `--apply` to write. Re-running is safe: a task
file that already exists is left alone, so an interrupted migration can simply
be run again.

Exit: 0 on success, 1 if nothing to migrate, 2 on error.
