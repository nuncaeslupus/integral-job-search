"""issue_for_task.py — which issue is the handle for a task.

The queue's completion mechanism is `Closes #<issue>` in a task PR: GitHub
closes the issue when the PR merges, so nothing has to remember to update the
board afterwards. That only works if the number is *known* at the moment the PR
is opened, and for a long time nothing computed it — the protocol told the model
to "make sure the body carries Closes #<issue>" while no script ever resolved
which issue that was. An instruction with no data behind it is a step that gets
skipped, and a skipped step here is a merged PR that leaves its task claimed
forever.

So this is the one place that answers it, from the issue list the caller already
fetched:

    issue_for_task.py --task t-3f8a91c2 --issues /tmp/arsenal-issues.json
    # → 42

Matching is `task_select.task_id_from_issue`, not a second regex — a resolver
that disagreed with the board about which issue belongs to which task would put
`Closes #<wrong>` on a PR, which closes someone else's work.

Exit: 0 and the number on stdout; 1 when no issue matches (the caller decides
whether that is fatal); 2 on unreadable input.
