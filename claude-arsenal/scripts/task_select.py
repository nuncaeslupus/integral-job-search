"""task_select.py — decide which task to work on next. Pure function, no network.

This is the piece that used to cost the most: choosing a task meant a session
walked a protocol, ran several scripts, and reasoned over their output in
context. Ordering is a computation, not a judgement call, so it belongs in a
script that answers in one line.

Two inputs, both cheap:

* **Task files** — `<home>/tasks/*.md`, each with YAML-ish front matter
  carrying `id`, `title`, `deps`, `priority`, `requires`. These are read from
  the repository, so the dependency graph is versioned with the code and
  identical for every agent.
* **State** — a JSON object mapping task id to `open` / `claimed` / `done`,
  supplied by the caller (`--state` or stdin). Keeping state *out* of this
  script is what makes it pure: it never touches git or GitHub, so it is
  trivially testable and cannot fail because a network call did.

A task is eligible when it is `open`, every dep is `done`, and every
`requires:` capability is offered by the current surface.

Output is one compact JSON object per line, best first — small on purpose,
since every byte lands in a model's context:

    {"id":"t-3f8a91c2","title":"...","path":"arsenal/tasks/t-3f8a91c2.md","priority":2,"gate":true}

`--max N` selects a batch for parallel fan-out. That batch can never contain a
task that depends on another task in it, because a dep that is not yet `done`
disqualifies its dependent outright — and it is capped at one task when the
worktree-isolation sentinel reads `unavailable`, since workers without separate
worktrees share one tree and clobber each other.

Exit: 0 always (an empty selection is an answer, not an error).
