"""query_status.py — the board: what is open, claimed, done, and what is blocking.

Reads the task graph from the repository and the state from the GitHub issues the
caller already fetched, so it cannot disagree with what the selector sees — both
derive from the same two inputs.

It makes one read-only network call of its own: `git ls-remote` for the remote
default branch's tip, to say whether the working tree those task files came from
is current. Nothing is fetched and no ref is written. `--no-remote-check` skips
it; a failure is silent, because a surface with no network still has a board.

    python3 claude-arsenal/scripts/query_status.py --issues /tmp/issues.json [--detail]

Exit: 0 always; 1 with --fail-on-problems if any task has no gate, no handle, or a
dependency that does not exist; 2 if --issues names a file that cannot be read or
parsed.
