# Updates a task's status in queue.jsonl, commits (the queue row AND the task
# payload, so any ## Failure notes / PR-URL edits land too), and pushes to the

# <status>: done | merged | open | blocked | in_progress | escalated
#   done       = PR opened + acceptance gate passed (the worker's terminal
#                state). `done` is enforced here, not by convention: it requires
#                an opened (non-closed) PR, the payload's mechanical gate to pass
#                (gate_run.sh), and — for a "laptop"-tagged task — a non-cloud
#                session. See the CA-11/CA-12/CA-13 guards below.
#   merged     = that PR later landed on the default branch; set by
#                reconcile_merged.sh after a `gh` merge-state check.
#   escalated  = task auto-set when attempts >= max_attempts (see update_task_row.py).
# --pr <url>: optional; records the per-task PR URL/number on the queue row.
# --reset-attempts: clear the attempts counter and return the task to open,
#                   bypassing the auto-escalation cap check. Only meaningful
#                   with status open; silently ignored for other statuses.
# Exit: 0 on success, 1 after 3 failed push attempts, 2 on misconfiguration
#       (wrong branch / protected branch / no upstream).
