# _timing.sh — how long a boundary took, appended to a local TSV. SOURCED, not run.
#
# Nothing in this bundle recorded how long anything took, so every consumer who
# hit a slow loop had to hand-instrument it or give up — and "the gate feels
# slow" has one natural response, which is to turn the gate off. The two most
# actionable reports this repo has had (#444, #445) exist only because somebody
# built that table by hand for a day.
#
# The boundary instrumented is the one arsenal already owns: every expensive
# step in the loop runs through a bundle script, so five `source` lines cover
# the whole of both reports without a PostToolUse hook, without correlating
# parallel tool calls, and without any always-on cost on turns nobody is
# measuring.
#
# Collection is always on; READING is on demand. A row is six fields and a
# couple of milliseconds, and nothing enters a context window until somebody
# runs `arsenal_timings.py`. That is the point: the data has to already exist
# when the problem appears, because that is exactly when you cannot go back and
# collect it.
#
# NEVER leaves the machine. No paths, no file contents, no diff — an event
# name, a caller-chosen label, a duration and an exit code. No network, no
# upload, no cross-repo aggregation, ever.
#
# Usage, at the top of a script that already anchors itself to the repo root:
#
#     source "${SCRIPT_DIR}/_timing.sh"
#     arsenal_timing_begin gate "${TASK_ID}" "${TASK_ID}"
#     trap 'arsenal_timing_end $?' EXIT       # or call it from an existing trap
#
# The trap is wired at the call site on purpose. Installing one from here would
# silently replace whatever EXIT trap the caller already had — gate_run.sh's
# temp-file cleanup, for one — and a metrics helper that leaks temp files is a
# bad trade for a number nobody asked for.
#
# For a duration this process did not measure end to end — a review round spans
# an `emit` and a later `verdict`, two separate invocations — call
# `arsenal_timing_record` with the milliseconds computed from the state those
# two share.
#
# Off entirely with ARSENAL_METRICS=off.

# Milliseconds since the epoch. bash 5 exports EPOCHREALTIME; bash 3.2 (still
# what `/usr/bin/env bash` finds on stock macOS) does not, and BSD `date` has no
# %N, so there the resolution is one second.
# ponytail: second resolution on old bash is fine for boundaries measured in
# seconds-to-minutes; if sub-second ever matters here, that is the upgrade path.
