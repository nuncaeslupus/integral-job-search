# check_update.sh — pull a newer claude-arsenal bundle when one is available.
#
# Compares the installed bundle version (claude-arsenal/.bundle-version) against
# the latest version tag on the upstream remote. When behind: runs
# `git subtree pull` to bring in the new bundle, then re-runs init.py --silent
# to propagate any file-level changes to the host project. Either way, prints
# the CHANGELOG.md entries between the installed version and the new one, so
# an update says what changed, not just the version number.
#
# NO SILENT "ALREADY CURRENT". Every path that declines to update says why. A
# consumer once re-vendored, was told it was current, and sat on a stale bundle
# for a whole session because two separate conditions both exited 0 without a
# word: no `arsenal` remote was configured (the bundle had been hand-copied, so
# there was nothing to compare against), and the upstream release was UNTAGGED
# (its tag workflow never ran), so the tag-gated check could not see it either.
# Both now report. The rules:
#   - no remote            → say so, name the remote, exit 0.
#   - newest tag > installed → update (as before).
#   - newest tag <= installed but the remote's default branch has moved past
#     that tag → read the branch's .bundle-version and, if it is newer, say so
#     loudly. An untagged upstream version is never merged automatically —
#     consumers pin to tags by contract — but they are told it exists.
#   - genuinely current    → say so.
# It also reports the one skew no other file can: a vendored init skill OLDER
# than the bundle it would rewrite (#237).
#
# NEVER DOWNGRADES. The old check was `installed != latest`, so a consumer on a
# hand-vendored 0.21.0 with a newest tag of v0.20.5 would "update" backwards.
# Versions are compared numerically now; only a strictly newer tag updates.

#                    vendored whole (say at vendor/claude-arsenal/) and the
