# open_task_pr.sh <task_id> <title> [<type>]
# Commit a worker's task changes on a feature branch cut from the host DEFAULT
# branch (origin/main), push it, and open a PR that closes the task's issue.
#
# Prints ONE line on stdout, consumed by the caller and recorded on the queue
# task's issue via the PR body's `Closes #<issue>` line:
#   <pr-url>            — a PR was created (a `gh` backend was available).
#   branch:<name>       — the branch was pushed but no PR backend exists here;
#                         the orchestrator/operator opens the PR (github skill /
#                         MCP). The branch ref is enough to do so.
#
# Conventional Commits message: `<type>: <title>` (type defaults to feat). The
# Co-Authored-By trailer is NEVER hardcoded — it is taken verbatim from
# ARSENAL_COAUTHOR ("Name <email>") when the caller exports the active model
# identity supplied by the harness. Absent it, no trailer is written.
#
# Env: ARSENAL_QUEUE_REMOTE (default origin); ARSENAL_COAUTHOR (optional);
#      ARSENAL_ALLOW_SHARED_ADD (operator escape hatch, see the guard below).
# Exit: 0 branch pushed (PR opened or branch emitted), 1 on push failure / usage.

# sweeping a CONCURRENT worker's files or secrets into this commit when workers
# share one checkout. The guard used to require ARSENAL_SURFACE=worktree — but
# nothing set it, so every worker hit the refusal and exported it itself. A
# guard the guarded party certifies is not a guard. So derive the answer:
#
#   1. A linked worktree (`git worktree add`) IS the isolation → allow.
#   2. Serialized in-place mode → allow. Not the caller's word for it: the
#      sentinel is written by worktree_probe.sh / worker_postcheck.sh (the
#      orchestrator's own probes), and `unavailable` is exactly what clamps
#      task_select.py to one worker — so there is no concurrent worker to
#      clobber.
#   3. Otherwise refuse. ARSENAL_ALLOW_SHARED_ADD=1 is the operator escape
#      hatch for a bespoke setup, named so it reads as what it is.
