# open_task_pr.sh <task_id> <title> [<type>]
# Commit a worker's task changes on a feature branch cut from the host DEFAULT
# branch (origin/main), push it, and open a PR that closes the task's issue.
#
# Prints ONE line on stdout, consumed by the caller and recorded on the queue
# task's issue via the PR body's `Closes #<issue>` line:
#   <pr-url>            — a PR was created (a `gh` backend was available).
#   branch:<name>       — the branch was pushed but no PR backend exists here;
#                         the orchestrator/operator opens the PR (github skill /
#                         MCP). The branch ref is enough to do so.
#
# Conventional Commits message: `<type>: <title>` (type defaults to feat). The
# Co-Authored-By trailer is NEVER hardcoded — it is taken verbatim from
# ARSENAL_COAUTHOR ("Name <email>") when the caller exports the active model
# identity supplied by the harness. Absent it, no trailer is written.
#
# The PR body AND the commit message both carry `Closes #<issue>`, because that
# is the whole completion mechanism: GitHub closes the task's issue when the PR
# merges, so no session has to remember to update the queue afterwards. The
# number is resolved here rather than left to the caller — this used to be an
# instruction in the worker's prose ("make sure the body carries Closes #N")
# with no data path behind it, so every PR this script opened closed nothing and
# every merged task stayed `claimed` until a human noticed. Both places on
# purpose: the body fires on a merge into the default branch, the commit message
# survives a squash and fires for a stacked PR whose base is another branch.
#
# It also moves the task file into `tasks/_history/` with `status: merged` as
# part of the PR's own diff, so the archive lands exactly when the merge does
# and no follow-up commit is owed to anyone.
#
# Three things are checked before any of that happens, in this order: whether a
# reviewer with no history of the work cleared this exact tree
# (`adversarial_review.sh check`), the host's own gate, and the task's
# acceptance gate. The last two are mechanical and say nothing about whether the
# change is the change that was asked for; the first is the only one that can.
# It runs first because the other two execute arbitrary consumer commands, and
# any untracked artifact they leave behind would move the tree out from under
# the review's digest and report a genuine CLEAR as stale.
#
# The outcome is written into the PR body under every mode but `off`, so a PR
# opened with no review on record says so where the person merging it will read
# it. The body states only what the receipt proves — that a verdict was recorded
# for this tree — not that any particular reviewer ran: nothing here can tell a
# subagent's verdict from one a session wrote itself.

# red repo needs no discipline; one that is asked to check first needs it every
# single time — and one handed a skip flag reaches for it precisely when the
# repo is red.

# There is deliberately no way to skip this. An escape hatch would be reached
# for exactly when a repo is red, which is the case the refusal exists for.
#
# 1. The pre-PR adversarial review — FIRST, before either gate runs.
#
#    The two gates below prove the change does not break the repo. Neither
#    can tell whether it does what the task asked, because both are
#    mechanical and the only reader who has judged that is the session that
#    wrote it. `adversarial_review.sh check` asks whether a reviewer with no
#    history of this work cleared THIS tree — digest-bound, so a CLEAR from
#    before the last edit does not count.
#
#    Order is load-bearing, and it was wrong the first time. Both gates below
#    run arbitrary consumer commands, and a gate that leaves any untracked
#    artifact — a timestamped log, a coverage report, __pycache__ — changes
#    the tree between the reviewer's verdict and this check. Running the
#    check afterwards therefore reported a genuine CLEAR as stale: under
#    `warn` the PR body then asserted something false on the one surface this
#    feature exists to make truthful, and under `required` the refusal could
#    never be cleared, because every retry re-ran the gate that invalidated
#    the receipt. Asking before the gates run removes the whole class.
#
#    What the receipt covers is the tree the AUTHOR produced, not the final PR
#    byte-for-byte: this script goes on to archive the task file into
#    `tasks/_history/` as part of the same diff, after this check. That mutation
#    is deliberately outside the review's scope — it is this helper's own
#    bookkeeping, identical on every task PR, and re-reviewing after it would
#    never converge, because the next run would mutate the tree again. No
#    author-written change can enter through it.
#
#    Default is `warn`, not a refusal, and that is deliberate: a hard gate
#    added to every existing worker loop overnight is a gate a consumer
#    disables on the first red morning. So the outcome is written into the PR
#    body instead, where the human who merges it reads it. Silence is what
#    this repo keeps getting bitten by, not friction. Set

# run it.

# branch at the moment the merge does, and if the PR never merges the task file
# never moves. No follow-up commit, no push to a protected branch, nothing to
