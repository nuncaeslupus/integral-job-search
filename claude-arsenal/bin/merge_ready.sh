#!/usr/bin/env bash
# merge_ready.sh <pr> — is this PR mergeable under the host's merge policy?
#
# Every session that merges used to answer this by writing its own `gh ... --jq`:
# the same three questions, spelled five different ways, each with its own bugs.
# The bugs were not random. They were the same two every time, because both are
# the shortcut the shell makes easy:
#
#   * reading "no failing checks" as green, when what the repo produced was NO
#     CHECKS AT ALL — a runner outage merges the whole queue;
#   * reading a review's summary state, when the finding list is the open
#     threads and a bot happily reports "review completed" over three of them.
#
# So the fetch lives here, once, and the verdict lives in `pr_audit.py`, once.
# This script is the half that knows how to ask GitHub; that script is the half
# that knows what the answers mean, and it is the same evaluator the fleet-wide
# audit runs, so one PR and forty PRs cannot disagree.
#
# CHECKS ARE FETCHED FOR THE HEAD SHA, not for the PR. A check run that reported
# on the previous push is evidence about the previous push. The distinction is
# invisible in `gh pr checks`, which is why it kept being lost.
#
# Stdout: the condition table, then the verdict. With `--body`, and only when
# the PR is ready, the merge commit body to carry.
#
# Exit: 0 ready to merge, 1 not ready (the table says what is missing),
#       2 error, 3 merge-policy is `never` — report it and let a human merge,
#       5 no scriptable GitHub channel; the calls to make are printed.
