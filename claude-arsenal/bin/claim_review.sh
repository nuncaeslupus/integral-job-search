# claim_review.sh <pr> <head-sha> — take exclusive ownership of reviewing one
# head, or fail cleanly.
#
# A review is a unit of expensive work — a second reader on a substantial PR is
# 135k–280k tokens and several minutes — and until now it was the only expensive
# unit in this bundle with no compare-and-swap. Tasks have `claim_task.sh`;
# reviews had a convention. Two sessions dispatched an Opus reader at the same
# head within minutes of each other, and the duplicate was only noticed because
# one session said so in a message. Coordination by announcement is exactly what
# the claim ref exists to stop needing.
#
# Same primitive as claim_task.sh, one more ref namespace:
#
#     POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/git/refs   →  422 "Reference already exists"
#
# THE HEAD SHA IS PART OF THE KEY, and that is the whole difference from a task
# claim. A task is claimed once; a review is about one tree. Keying on the PR
# number alone would mean the first reader's claim blocks a re-read after three
# more pushes — the stale-review case is the one a fleet hits most — while
# keying on the head means a new push is a new unit of work, claimable by
# whoever gets there first. It also makes the claim say something true: this
# ref is the receipt that THIS tree is being read.
#
# Stdout:
#   won <ref>            — the review is yours
#   lost                 — somebody is already reading this head
#   manual <METHOD> <PATH> <BODY>
#                        — no scriptable GitHub channel here; make this exact
#                          call with your built-in GitHub tools and treat
#                          201 as `won`, 422 as `lost`
# Exit: 0 won, 1 lost, 5 manual, 2 error.
