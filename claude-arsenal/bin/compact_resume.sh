#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Two hooks, registered by /init and by the core plugin:
#
#   compact_resume.sh          SessionStart, matcher `compact`
#   compact_resume.sh record   PostToolUse on Write / Edit / MultiEdit
#
# Compaction replaces the transcript with a summary, and a summary drops exactly
# what a long task needs to continue: the decisions already taken, the approaches
# already ruled out, and the next command. `execution` keeps those in the Resume
# section of tmp/<task-id>-notes.md; the SessionStart hook prints that section and
# a short `git status` so they land back in context right after compaction. (A
# PreCompact hook cannot do this — its output never reaches the model.)
#
# Which task is this session on? `record` answers it at every moment: each edit
# of a notes file writes tmp/.arsenal-sessions/<session_id> → that file. The
# session id survives compaction, so several agents sharing one checkout each
# get their own notes back. Without a record it falls back to a notes file named
# in the branch, then to the newest one — and says it guessed.
#
# Silent when there is no recent notes file, so a repo that never uses them pays
# nothing. Never blocks: always exits 0.
