# Quota governance — the token-budget stop

Read this when the loop stopped before dispatch, or when tuning how much a
session is allowed to spend.

## Quota governance — token-budget stop

`statusline_capture.sh` (registered by `/init` as the host `statusLine` command)
writes `arsenal/session/rate_limits.json` (gitignored) from the
`rate_limits` block Claude Code feeds a statusLine on stdin — the only channel
that data arrives on. Before every dispatch, the loop runs `budget_check.sh`:

- Either window (`five_hour` / `seven_day`) at/above `ARSENAL_QUOTA_STOP_PCT`
  (default 90) → exit `3`: stop, write `handover.md`, report the reset time.
- File missing / fields absent (non-Pro/Max plan, before the first response,
  older Claude Code) → exit `0`, **fail-open**: the loop runs where quota is not
  observable.

`rate_limits` is a snapshot at the last message and is **Pro/Max only**; on
API/metered usage the quota check always fails open. So `budget_check.sh` also
enforces an **always-available** per-session dispatch-round cap
(`ARSENAL_MAX_ITERATIONS`, default 50; `0` disables) that does not depend on
observable quota — the real ceiling for an auto-dispatching loop on metered
billing. The counter resets per session — `CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE_SESSION_ID`, falling
back to `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`, the same pair `references/claiming-internals.md`
names; `CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` is set on no current surface — and lives in the gitignored
`arsenal/session/budget_iterations.json`.
