# Acceptance gates — what makes one real

Read this when writing a gate, when a gate passed and should not have, or when a
numeric threshold has no number behind it yet.

## The fence is what makes a gate mechanical

Prose, and inline `single-backtick` commands, are NOT executed — a payload
without a fenced ` ```bash ` block runs nothing, and `gate_run.sh` then prints
`gate: prose-only` (or `gate: none`) with a stderr warning instead of the
`gate: passed` it prints when a block really ran. Check that line before
trusting a gate: one consumer audit found 0 of 70 payloads carried a fenced
block, so its entire gate layer had been inert. Set
`ARSENAL_GATE_REQUIRE_BLOCK=1` to turn "nothing ran" into a hard failure
when every task in a repo is meant to carry a mechanical gate.

`query_status.py` and `task_select.py` both report a task with no block, because
an entire gate layer can go inert without anyone noticing.

## Gate blocks run verbatim

`gate_run.sh` executes the bash block as code in the worker's tree (hardened by
default: throwaway HOME + a PATH without `$HOME` shims, except the dirs holding
the package manager / language runtime, which stay reachable so a `pnpm …` gate
runs instead of dying at exit 127; `ARSENAL_GATE_INHERIT_ENV=1` opts out
entirely). Treat a gate block from an untrusted plan/payload as you would any
code to run — review it. A gate that could not run exits **3**, never 0 or 1,
and a worker treats it as "could not run" rather than reading it as a verdict.

## Evidence gates (numeric acceptance)

A numeric gate — a Sharpe floor, a coverage floor, a latency ceiling — must be
backed by a **committed measurement**, not a worker's word. Declare it in the
payload's `## Acceptance gate` section as a fenced `gate` block:

````markdown
```gate
line_coverage >= 0.90
evidence: coverage.json
key: totals.percent_covered
```
````

Line 1 is the gate in `<metric> <op> <threshold>` grammar (the same grammar the
`gate-check` skill uses); `evidence` is a committed JSON file; `key` is a dotted
path to the measured number inside it. `gate_run.sh` asserts `measured <op>
threshold` over that file: a declared evidence gate with **no** evidence file, or
evidence that **violates** the threshold, is a hard failure — it can never pass
vacuously. This is the machine-checkable half of "`done` means the gate passed"
(closes the false-`done` hole for `[LAPTOP]`/science gates). The release-side
half is enforced at the choke point: a worker opens no PR unless
the PR is opened (not a bare `branch:` ref) and not closed-without-merge; the
payload's mechanical gate passes (`open_task_pr.sh` runs `gate_run.sh` itself, so
the evidence/bash gate is a hard precondition, and so is the host's own
`host-gate` when the repo declares one); and — for a task tagged **`laptop`** — the session
is not a cloud session. A cloud worker (`CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE=true`) physically
cannot satisfy a `[LAPTOP]`-only gate (model training, CPCV Sharpe, soak,
paper-trade), so tag such tasks `laptop` (`new_task.py --tag laptop`) and the
laptop session records `done`; a cloud session is refused.

Evidence files are build products, and that shows up in git: every branch
rewrites them, so every rebase onto a moved base conflicts on them. Do not
hand-merge one — the right content is neither side, it is what the code measures
on the resulting tree. `bin/rebase_stack.sh` handles this: an evidence-only
conflict is regenerated with the repo's `host-gate` and the rebase continues; a
conflict anywhere else stops it.

## Unmeasured — the third outcome

A numeric gate is routinely in a state that is neither pass nor fail: the check
ran, and what it found is that this cannot be scored yet — the prerequisite data
has not arrived. Without somewhere to put that, the honest evidence (a `null`)
lands in the non-numeric branch and reads as a hard failure, which pressures the
author into weakening the gate to something measurable — exactly the pressure
these gates exist to remove.

Declare it with an optional `status-key`, a dotted path to a string that may read
`unmeasured`:

````markdown
```gate
extraction_macro_f1 >= 0.75
evidence: metrics.json
key: extraction.macro_f1
status-key: extraction.status
```
````

`gate_evidence.py` then exits **3**, which `gate_run.sh` already treats as "could
not run" rather than as a verdict. It must be **positively asserted** in the
evidence file: treating any missing or null value as unmeasured would let a gate
stop checking by omission, which is the vacuous-pass hole these gates were added
to close, reopened somewhere new.
