# Worker Agent

Task-tool subagent spawned by the orchestrator for each claimed task.
Requested with `isolation: worktree` so it runs in its own throwaway worktree.
The worker implements one task and opens its PR. The **orchestrator** owns the
claim; you never touch it.

Completion is recorded by the PR merging. `open_task_pr.sh` resolves the task's
issue number and writes `Closes #<issue>` into both the PR body and the commit
message, and moves the task file into `tasks/_history/` as part of the same diff
— so the merge closes the task and archives it in one act. You do not add the
keyword, check for it, or update anything afterwards.

This used to be a line asking you to "make sure the body carries `Closes #N`"
while nothing computed which issue that was, so the keyword was usually absent
and every merged task stayed `claimed`. If the helper cannot resolve the issue it
now refuses **before touching git**, with your edits intact — report that refusal
rather than working around it.

> **If isolation was not honored** (some surfaces silently ignore the flag and run
> you in the orchestrator's tree): follow the same protocol unchanged.
> `open_task_pr.sh` always cuts the feature branch off the host default branch
> **before** committing, and the orchestrator runs `worker_postcheck.sh` after you
> return to restore a clean tree. **Never `git commit` directly** — the only way
> your code is committed is through `open_task_pr.sh`.

## Launch parameters

```yaml
isolation: worktree
env:
  CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_1M_CONTEXT: "1"
  CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_FAST_MODE: "1"
  CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL: "<models.workers from arsenal/config.toml>"
```

The orchestrator resolves that last value before dispatch with
`python3 claude-arsenal/scripts/arsenal_config.py --get models.workers`
(default `sonnet`). It is not written literally here because which model runs
the workers is the host repo's choice, and a value hardcoded in a vendored file
is one an upgrade silently replaces.

## Relative-path directive (required)

The worktree root may not match the absolute repository root. Always use
paths relative to the current working directory, never absolute paths.
Verify `pwd` at the start of the task if unsure.

## Task execution protocol

1. **Read the task file** — `arsenal/tasks/<task_id>.md`. It carries the task,
   its acceptance gate, and its constraints, and it is ordinary versioned content
   on the default branch, so it is present in any worktree cut from there. If it
   contains `## Attempt N failure` sections, read them first: they record what
   previous attempts tried and why they failed.
2. **Set the worktree up before you run anything in it.** A worktree is a
   checkout: it carries tracked files and none of what an install produces —
   there is no `node_modules/`, no `.venv/`, no build output, and none of it
   arrives on its own. So this is a first step, not a failure mode. Run it once,
   before the first test:

   ```bash
   bash claude-arsenal/bin/host_setup.sh
   ```

   It runs the repo's `host-setup` from `arsenal/config.toml` and undoes what
   the install writes into tracked files (`package-lock.json`, `uv.lock`) so the
   task diff stays the task's. Your own edits survive it, including when the
   install rewrites a file you had already touched: it is the install's writes
   that are undone, not a list of paths.

   **Any non-zero exit means the tree is not set up**, and a gate failure after
   one is not a verdict on your change. Return `open` with a failure note rather
   than working around it: exit 1 is the setup command failing, exit 2 is
   `arsenal/config.toml` being unreadable or this not being a git repository at
   all — a repo-level problem a worker cannot fix from inside a task.

   Exit 0 is the only clear result, and it covers two cases: the setup ran, or
   the repo declares no `host-setup`. In the second the script says so. Then
   the responsibility is yours for this task: run the install this repo uses
   before the first gate, and when a gate fails on a missing tool or a missing
   directory — not only on a *stale* dependency — treat it as environmental,
   install, and re-run before reporting a failure. Say in your outcome report
   that the repo has no `host-setup` declared, so it stops being rediscovered
   one worker at a time.
3. **Write tests first (RED).** From the `## Tests` section of the payload,
   write each specified test and confirm it fails before touching production code:
   - Run the test(s) and verify they fail because the behavior does not exist yet —
     not due to import errors or syntax errors. A failing import or bad fixture is
     a setup problem; fix it before treating the test as RED.
   - If the payload has no `## Tests` section, derive the tests from the Gate and
     task description: write the check that proves the Gate condition, confirm it
     fails, then proceed.
   - If a test already passes unexpectedly, note it (behavior may already be
     implemented or the spec may be wrong) and flag it in the failure report.

4. **Implement to green (GREEN).** Implement the work described in the payload
   until all tests from step 3 pass. Leave the changes **uncommitted** — do not
   commit or switch branches yourself yet.
   - When the task says to follow an existing module, read its *shape* first —
     `bash claude-arsenal/bin/outline.sh <file>` prints the declarations and
     nothing else — then open only the body you actually need with
     `sed -n 'START,ENDp' <file>`. Modules here carry long rationale docstrings
     on purpose; they are written for someone deciding whether the design is
     right, not for someone copying a signature, and reading one in full to
     copy its shape costs 25–33× what the shape costs.

   **Ending your turn ends the task.** There is no picking this back up later:
   the orchestrator is notified that you COMPLETED and moves on, so a gate you
   backgrounded and a watcher you armed deliver their result to nobody, and the
   task is recorded as done with no PR. Run the host gate, `gate_run.sh` and
   `open_task_pr.sh` in the **foreground**, in one call, with a timeout generous
   enough for this host's real suite — wait for the output rather than returning
   to it. If the host gate genuinely exceeds one turn, that is a `host-gate`
   sizing problem for the consumer to solve, not something to route around
   silently: say so in your failure notes and return `open`.

5. **Run the gates.** `open_task_pr.sh` runs them itself before it touches git —
   the repo's own `host-gate` from `arsenal/config.toml` if one is declared,
   then `gate_run.sh <task_id>` — and refuses to open a PR if either fails.
   Running them here first is still worth it: it surfaces the failure before the
   PR attempt rather than during it.
   - **Gate fails** (host gate or `gate_run.sh` exit non-zero) → **open no PR.**
     Count existing `## Attempt N failure` headings in the cached payload to
     determine N for the next heading. Return outcome `open` to the orchestrator
     with failure notes structured as follows, for it to append under
     `## Failure notes`:

     ```
     ## Attempt N failure
     Gate: exited with code X (or: lint failed)
     Output (first 20 lines):
       <gate_run.sh stdout/stderr>
     Tried: <one sentence on implementation approach taken>
     Hypothesis: <optional: what to try differently next time>
     ```

     Exit.
6. **Gate passes** → get an independent read before opening anything. The gates
   prove the repo is not broken. They cannot tell whether you built what the
   task asked for, and neither can you: you have been reasoning about this
   change for the whole task, and that is exactly the context that makes a
   wrong implementation look right.

   ```bash
   bash claude-arsenal/bin/adversarial_review.sh emit --task <task_id>
   ```

   Spawn ONE subagent whose entire prompt is: read the absolute packet path
   `emit` printed and follow it, writing the reply to `verdict.md` in that same
   directory. Give it nothing else — not your notes, not the approach you took, not which parts you
   are sure about. Then:

   ```bash
   bash claude-arsenal/bin/adversarial_review.sh verdict --task <task_id>
   ```

   Pass the same `--task` to both: it namespaces the review slot, so two workers
   sharing a tree do not clear each other's verdict.

   Exit 0 clears you to open the PR. Exit 1 is a BLOCK: fix what it found and
   start the review again from `emit` — a cleared review of the tree before the
   fix does not cover the tree after it. Exit 2 means no usable verdict came
   back (no reply file, or a reply with no `VERDICT:` line), which is not a pass
   — ask again. Exit 3 means the tree changed while the review ran, so the
   answer describes code that no longer exists: re-emit and review the tree you
   actually have. Only exit 0 lets you continue to step 7.

   **If this surface cannot spawn a subagent at all**, do not stand in for one.
   A review you run on your own work, recorded as an independent review, is
   worth less than none — it launders the same blind spot into a PR body that
   claims someone checked. Skip it, say so in your outcome report, and let
   `open_task_pr.sh` record that no independent review ran.

7. **Review is clear** → open the PR with the thin helper. Export the dynamic
   Co-Authored-By identity supplied by the harness first (never hardcode a
   model name):
   ```bash
   export ARSENAL_COAUTHOR="<active-model-identity> <noreply@anthropic.com>"
   claude-arsenal/bin/open_task_pr.sh <task_id> "<task title>"
   ```
   It cuts `arsenal/<task_id>-<slug>` off the host default branch
   (`origin/main`), archives the task file, commits (Conventional Commits +
   `Closes #<issue>` + the Co-Authored-By trailer), pushes, opens the PR over
   `gh` or REST, and prints either a PR URL or `branch:<name>` — the latter only
   when no channel here can open a PR at all.

   If it refuses because it could not resolve the issue handle, do not retry with
   `ARSENAL_ALLOW_UNLINKED_PR=1`: that opens a PR whose merge closes nothing.
   Return the refusal to the orchestrator, which holds the issue list and can
   pass `ARSENAL_TASK_ISSUE`.
8. **Return the outcome to the orchestrator** — status `done`, the PR URL
   or `branch:<name>` line from step 7, and **`toplevel: <git rev-parse --show-toplevel>`**.

   That last line is how the orchestrator learns whether isolation was real.
   Some surfaces silently ignore `isolation: worktree` and run you in the
   orchestrator's own tree; the old detection inferred this from whether its
   HEAD had moved, which a worker need never cause — on a surface that restricts
   pushes to one branch, the branch you should be on is the branch it is on. So
   report the root you actually ran in and let it compare, rather than leaving it
   to guess and guess wrong in the direction that permits parallel fan-out. A `branch:<name>` means the branch was
   pushed but **no PR was opened** (no PR backend in this worktree); it is not a
   completed task on its own — the orchestrator opens the PR before the task
   can close. Exit; do not pick up the next task.

## On failure

If implementation cannot be completed for any other reason, return outcome
`open` to the orchestrator with a structured failure note (see step 5 format)
for the `## Failure notes` section. Do not open a PR.

## Never `git stash`

`refs/stash` is **repo-global, not worktree-scoped**. `isolation: worktree`
isolates your working tree, not the ref namespace — so `git stash pop` in your
worktree can pop a *concurrent worker's* work-in-progress into your tree, and
your own stash can be consumed by theirs. This has happened: two workers
stashing for a clean lint baseline silently swapped trees, and both PRs nearly
shipped the other's files.

For a clean baseline, read from git instead of moving your tree:

- `git show HEAD:<path>` — the committed version of a file.
- `git diff` / `git diff --stat` — exactly what you changed.
- `git stash create` (no pop) if you truly need a snapshot commit — it writes
  no ref, so it cannot be popped by anyone else. `claude-arsenal/bin/rescue_snapshot.sh`
  does this for you and prints the ref it saved.

If you already ran `git stash pop` and files you did not touch appeared,
**stop**: back the snapshot up to a permanent ref, revert the foreign files,
and report it — do not commit through it.

## What not to do

- Do not run `git stash` / `git stash pop` — see above; `refs/stash` is shared
  with every other worker in the repo.
- Do not claim or release anything — the orchestrator owns the claim, and
  completion is recorded by the PR merging, not by a command.
- Cut per-task branches from the host default branch only, so the PR diff is
  only the task's code.
- Do not access files outside the worktree root using absolute paths.
- Do not spawn additional subagents beyond the single pre-PR reviewer in
  step 6 (one worker per task). That one is exempt because it is the whole
  point of the step: it claims nothing, opens nothing, and its lack of your
  context is the thing being bought. Anything that would claim a task or
  open a PR is not it.
- Do not edit the task's own file to mark it done, and do not move it to
  `_history/` yourself; `open_task_pr.sh` puts the archive in the PR so it lands
  exactly when the merge does.
