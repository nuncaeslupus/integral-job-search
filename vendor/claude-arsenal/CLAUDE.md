# claude-arsenal — internal CLAUDE.md

This file is **internal to the `claude-arsenal` marketplace**. It is not
shipped to consumers; it describes how Claude operates *inside this repo*
during plugin development. Consumer projects use their own `CLAUDE.md`.

It does **not** redeclare global preferences from `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` —
those still apply when you operate here. This file only adds the
marketplace-local conventions on top.

---

## What this repo is

`claude-arsenal` is a Claude Code marketplace. Plugins live at
`plugins/<name>/`; each plugin ships skills, hooks, and optional agents.
The `skill-creator` plugin is the meta-skill that gates every other edit
inside a `skills/` folder.

The migration plan that built this repo is preserved in the author's
local `~/.claude/plans/` (historical reference only; v0.1.0 is the
cutover).

## Working in this repo

| If the task is… | Use… |
|---|---|
| Authoring or modifying a skill | `/skill-creator:skill-creator` — runs the rubric and writes findings. |
| Touching a SKILL.md / references / scripts inside a plugin | The pre-edit hook blocks unless `skill-creator` is loaded. |
| Adding a new plugin | Scaffold `plugins/<name>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, then add the entry to `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`. |
| Running the rule-drift check | `make audit-rule-drift` — diffs `references/skill-rules.md` against `docs/research/claude-skill-system_v1.17.md`. |
| Checking this repo's own queue health | `make queue-doctor` — runs the queue consistency checker on `status/queue/` (dogfood). |
| Updating dependencies | `uv sync`, then commit `uv.lock`. |

The Makefile is the entry point for every routine action. Run `make help`
to list targets.

### Dogfooding the queue

This repo runs its own backlog on the same queue consumers get: task files in
`arsenal/tasks/`, one `arsenal:task` issue per task as its handle. `make
queue-doctor` (and the `queue doctor` CI job) runs `query_status.py` over it on
every push with `--fail-on-problems`, so a task with no fenced gate, no issue
handle, or a dep no task file declares fails the build.

`arsenal/tasks/` is currently empty, which makes that check pass vacuously — it
is a guard on the backlog, not evidence there is one. Add task files as review
work comes in rather than treating a green `queue-doctor` as a full dogfood.

**This repo does not run `arsenal-queue.yml` itself.** The workflow ships in
`plugins/core/skills/init/assets/workflows/` and `/init` installs it into a
*consumer's* `.github/workflows/`, where it calls `claude-arsenal/scripts/…`.
Upstream has no vendored `claude-arsenal/` prefix — it is the source of it — so
those paths do not resolve here. The dogfood covers the task files and the board;
the workflow's behaviour is covered by `plugins/core/tests/queue_hooks_test.sh`,
which exercises its planners directly.

## Branch policy

Default policy is conventional-commits on short-lived feature branches
with PR review. The `github` skill documents the canonical
commit/branch format.

The repo was renamed `my-skills` → `claude-arsenal` at v0.1.0 via the
GitHub Settings UI (preserves history and sets up redirects); no
`git mv` was performed on the working tree.

### Multi-PR autonomous work — stacking rule

When a plan produces **N PRs that will be merged in sequence**, follow the stacking rule documented in the `github` skill's SKILL.md (shipped to consumers). Key points: branches must stack from the start, and **only the last PR in the stack bumps `.bundle-version`** — intermediate PRs ship content at the current version. After each merge, rebase the next branch with `--onto` to skip the now-merged commits.

---

## Versioning — mandatory on every PR

Every PR that ships user-visible changes **must** bump
`plugins/core/skills/init/assets/.bundle-version` before merging.
The `tag-release` workflow reads this file on every push to `main` and
creates a new git tag (`v<version>`) automatically if it does not already
exist. Consumer projects pin to these tags to re-vendor the marketplace.

`.bundle-version` is the **single canonical version** for the whole repo.
The plugin manifests (`plugins/*/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`), the
vendored `AGENTS.md` header, and the consumer `ARSENAL_REF` pin examples
in `docs/INSTALL.md` all carry a copy of it that is **derived, never
hand-edited**: after bumping `.bundle-version`, run `make sync-version` to
propagate it. CI's `make sync-version-check` fails the build if any copy
drifts. (Historically these drifted independently — issue #80.)

Tagging is automatic via that workflow. **If GitHub Actions is unavailable**
(an outage, no runners, a spending limit), the push-triggered run never fires
and the release ships **untagged** — which is invisible from here but breaks
every consumer: `check_update.sh` gates on the newest tag, so they keep being
told the previous version is the latest. This has happened twice (`v0.20.4`,
`v0.21.0`).

Two things now cover it:

- `tag-release.yml` also runs on a daily `schedule` and on `workflow_dispatch`,
  so a tag missed during an outage is created automatically once Actions
  recovers. It is a no-op when the tag already exists.
- `make tag` from `main` remains the immediate fallback (creates+pushes
  `v<.bundle-version>`, skips if it exists, refuses a version lower than the
  latest tag, mirroring the workflow).

### Tagging is NOT automatic when Actions is down — ask the user to do it

**After merging any version bump, run `make release-check`.** It asks the remote
— not the local repo — whether `v<.bundle-version>` is published. Never assume
the workflow ran.

When it reports `NO TAG`, **a Claude session usually cannot fix it**: the git
proxy in a cloud session (web, desktop and mobile apps, Claude Tag, routines)
rejects pushes to `refs/tags/*`, so `make tag` will create the tag locally and
fail to publish it. Verified, not assumed.

So in that situation the rule is: **stop and ask the user to run it from their
own machine.** Say it plainly, with the command and the reason:

> `v<version>` is merged but not tagged, and I cannot push tags from this
> session. Consumers gate updates on the newest remote tag, so until this runs
> they will keep being told the previous version is current:
> ```
> git checkout main && git pull && make tag
> ```

Do not treat this as a minor loose end and do not let it fall off the end of a
session — an untagged release looks completely fine from inside this repo while
being invisible to every consumer of it. That is exactly how `v0.20.4` and
`v0.21.0` shipped untagged.

Never work around it by editing `check_update.sh`, moving a consumer's pin to a
branch, or telling the user the release is done. The only fix is a real tag on
the remote.

Bump rules:
- **Patch** (`x.y.Z`) — bug fixes, doc corrections, validator tweaks.
- **Minor** (`x.Y.0`) — new skills, new workflow steps, new hooks, new flags.
- **Major** (`X.0.0`) — breaking changes to skill interfaces or plugin layout.

PRs that only touch `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/`, CI config, the `Makefile`, or
`pyproject.toml` dev tooling may skip the bump — none of it is vendored by a
consumer, which is exactly what the `version bump` CI job checks: it requires a
bump only when `plugins/*/skills/`, `plugins/*/.claude-plugin/` or
`.claude-plugin/` changes. All other PRs must include the bump commit, or the
reviewer should request it before merging.

## What lives where (and what does not)

- **Global preferences** (Python defaults, Makefile policy, "don't add
  features beyond what was asked", "surgical changes only") live in
  `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and apply automatically. **Not duplicated here.**
- **Marketplace-local conventions** (plugin layout, branch policy, the
  `claude-arsenal:<plugin>:<skill>` cite form) live in **this** file.
- **Skill rubric** (the ~98 author-checkable rule rows that the
  validator enforces) lives in
  `plugins/skill-creator/skills/skill-creator/references/skill-rules.md`.
  The validator cites rule IDs back to
  `docs/research/claude-skill-system_v1.17.md § <section>`.
- **Deferred rules** (the ~91 meta-only governance IDs) live one-line-each
  in `plugins/skill-creator/skills/skill-creator/references/research-coverage.md`
  with `§` anchors back to the research doc.

---

## Cite form

When referencing a skill or its reference, use the marketplace-namespaced
form:

- Skill: `claude-arsenal:<plugin>:<skill>` (e.g. `claude-arsenal:core:specify`).
- Reference: `claude-arsenal:<plugin>:<skill> § references/<file>.md`.
- Rubric row: cite the rule ID (e.g. `R-FM-3`) and let the validator's
  `findings.md` carry the file:line back-reference.

`R-*` and `Q-*` IDs **must not appear in SKILL.md body prose** —
`Q-EVER-1` (the content-quality scanner) enforces this. They live in
rubric rows and validator findings only.

---

## Listing budget

The skills index has an 8000-character cap (name + description per
skill). Locally, `make audit` reports per-plugin contribution and
headroom; under the hood it runs
`audit_library.py plugins/*/skills --by-plugin`, which is also what
consumers should point at their own `~/.claude/plugins/cache` when they
hit the cap. Aim for ≥50 % headroom across the default install set.

## Host-repo CLAUDE.md flags consumed by core skills

Core skills read optional HTML-comment markers from the **host repo's**
`CLAUDE.md` (not this one) to adapt their behavior. This is the full
registry of flags a core skill honors:

- `<!-- test-discipline: test-first | test-after -->` — default
  `test-first`. Read by `execution`: `test-after` writes tests alongside
  the change instead of failing-test-first (see `execution` Step 2a).
- `<!-- session-end: handoff=yes | ticket | no -->` — no default (the
  skill asks once, then writes the marker). Read by `session-end`: `yes`
  writes `status/handoff.md`; `ticket` and `no` skip it (Step 1).
- `<!-- github-skill: projects=classic | v2 | none -->` — auto-detected
  on first run. Read by `github` to skip GitHub Projects re-detection in
  later sessions.

Markers are per-host-repo and optional; absent a marker each skill uses
its default (or asks once, for `session-end`).
