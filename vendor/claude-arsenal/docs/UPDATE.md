# Updating claude-arsenal

`/plugin update claude-arsenal` rewrites the marketplace cache. This
page tells you which files survive that rewrite, which get
overwritten, and how to customise a vendored skill without losing your
edits on the next update.

## File ownership

| Path | Owner | Survives `/plugin update`? |
|---|---|---|
| `~/.claude/plugins/cache/claude-arsenal/**` | plugin | **No** — wiped and rewritten. |
| `~/.claude/plugins/cache/claude-arsenal/**/findings.md` | author-local log | **No** — wiped on update; never commit findings upstream from cache. |
| `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | consumer | Yes. |
| `~/.claude/settings.json` | consumer | Yes. |
| `~/.claude/keybindings.json` | consumer | Yes. |
| `<project>/CLAUDE.md` | consumer | Yes. |
| `<project>/.claude/skills/**` | consumer | Yes. |
| `<project>/.claude/settings.json` | consumer | Yes. |
| `<project>/.claude/settings.local.json` | consumer (gitignored) | Yes. |
| `<project>/<skill>/findings.md` | consumer (gitignored) | Yes. |
| `<project>/claude-arsenal/**` | plugin (vendored bundle) | **No** — refreshed by `init.py`; never edit here. |
| `<project>/arsenal/**` | consumer — tasks, specs, plans, config, session | Yes. Never written by an update. |

Anything under the cache directory is regenerated wholesale. Anything
under `~/.claude/` (outside the cache) or your project root is yours.

## Customising a vendored skill

**Never edit files in the cache directory.** The next `/plugin update`
will discard your changes silently.

To customise a skill the marketplace ships:

1. Copy the skill folder into your project: `cp -r
   ~/.claude/plugins/cache/claude-arsenal/plugins/core/skills/specify
   <project>/.claude/skills/`.
2. Edit the copy. Claude Code resolves skills with project-level
   precedence over plugin-level, so your fork takes over.
3. (Optional) Document the divergence in your project's `CLAUDE.md` so
   teammates know the local version is the source of truth.
4. Run `validate.py` on the fork before committing — the meta-skill's
   rubric still applies:

   ```bash
   uv run python \
     ~/.claude/plugins/cache/claude-arsenal/plugins/skill-creator/skills/skill-creator/scripts/validate.py \
     <project>/.claude/skills/specify
   ```

If the cache later ships a fix to the original skill, you have to
rebase your fork manually — `/plugin update` does not touch your
project-level copy.

---

## Audit after an update

After a non-trivial update, confirm the listing budget still has
headroom:

```bash
uv run python \
  ~/.claude/plugins/cache/claude-arsenal/plugins/skill-creator/skills/skill-creator/scripts/audit_library.py \
  ~/.claude/plugins/cache/claude-arsenal/plugins/*/skills \
  --by-plugin
```

A breach prints `OVER cap by N chars` and a hint to `/plugin disable
<plugin>` for tasks that do not need that plugin's skills.

## Refreshing the vendored trees (CC web)

Consumers who vendor the skills for Claude Code on the web have two trees to
keep up to date, and exactly one of them is upstream's:

- **`.claude/skills/`** — the flattened skill files; refreshed by
  `make update-skills` (or directly with `<clone>/scripts/vendor-skills.sh`).
- **`claude-arsenal/`** — the runtime bundle (`AGENTS.md`, `bin/`, `scripts/`);
  refreshed by re-running `init.py`.

`arsenal/` is **yours** — tasks, specs, plans, config, session state — and no
update writes to it. That split is the whole point: upstream owns one directory
and may overwrite it freely, so an upgrade can never touch your work.

```bash
# 1. Re-vendor the skills
make update-skills

# 2. Refresh claude-arsenal/ (bin/, scripts/, AGENTS.md)
python3 .claude/skills/init/scripts/init.py --repo-path .

# 3. Commit both trees
git add .claude/skills claude-arsenal
git commit -m "chore: vendor claude-arsenal @ vX.Y.Z"
```

`init.py --repo-path .` is idempotent: it overwrites stale bundle files and
scaffolds anything missing under `arsenal/`, but never rewrites an `arsenal/`
file that already exists.

### Coming from a release before v0.25.0

v0.25.0 replaced the `arsenal-queue` coordination branch with task files, issue
handles, and atomic claims, and moved host-owned state out of the vendored
prefix. Run the migration once, after refreshing the trees above:

```bash
python3 claude-arsenal/scripts/arsenal_migrate.py            # dry run — writes nothing
python3 claude-arsenal/scripts/arsenal_migrate.py --apply
```

It converts queue rows into `arsenal/tasks/<id>.md` files (ids preserved, so
`deps` keep resolving), moves `session/` and `project/` to `arsenal/`, and seeds
`arsenal/config.toml`. Finished tasks are recorded in
`arsenal/tasks/_migrated-history.md` rather than resurrected as work. Re-running
is safe. `docs/queue.md` covers the model and the few cleanup steps a sandboxed
session cannot do for you (deleting the old branch and worktree).

### Two ways this silently does nothing (or undoes your work)

Both were hit by a real consumer repo in one session:

**A stale `ARSENAL_REF` makes `make update-skills` a successful no-op.** The pin
is a literal in the consumer's Makefile and nothing compares it against the
latest tag, so a repo pinned three releases back re-vendors the *same old
version* and reports `vendored N skill(s)` — a success message for an update
that did not happen. `check_update.sh` is the automated counterpart, but it is
**inert unless the consumer added an `arsenal` git remote**, which vendoring
consumers have no reason to do. Check the pin against the tag list before
assuming you are current:

```bash
git ls-remote --tags https://github.com/nuncaeslupus/claude-arsenal.git 'refs/tags/v*' \
  | sed 's|.*refs/tags/||' | sort -V | tail -1
```

**A local edit to `claude-arsenal/bin/` is reverted by the next `init.py`.**
"Only overwrites stale scripts" reads like a safety guarantee, and for your
`arsenal/` tree it is — but `init.py` decides staleness by **checksum against the
plugin source**, so a script you patched locally is by definition stale and gets
overwritten, printing only `refreshed: bin/<name>.sh`. That is the intended
design, and it means **the bundle is not a place to fix bugs**: patch it
upstream and re-vendor, or your fix disappears at the next session start without
a warning. A consumer repo lost two gate-enforcement fixes this way before
noticing they were still present only because the fixes had *also* been
committed to the consumer's own tree.

## Rolling back

Marketplace install does not pin a version — `/plugin update` always
fetches the tip of `main`. If a fresh update breaks something:

```text
/plugin marketplace remove claude-arsenal
/plugin marketplace add github:nuncaeslupus/claude-arsenal
```

If that does not help, file an issue against
`nuncaeslupus/claude-arsenal` with the commit SHA the cache currently
holds (`git -C ~/.claude/plugins/cache/claude-arsenal rev-parse HEAD`).
