# queue-status

Reports task counts by status from `claude-arsenal/queue/tasks.jsonl`: total, open, in-progress, done, merged, and blocked. With `--detail`, lists each task's ID, title, status, assignee, and unmet dependency IDs.

CANARY: queue-status-loaded-2026-06-13-fb78d23e-d4e5f6a7b8c9d0e1

## When to load

Load this skill when:

- The user asks "how is the queue?", "what tasks are left?", "queue status", or "/queue-status".
- Checking whether all tasks are done before closing a loop session.
- Diagnosing a stuck queue (tasks in `blocked` status with unmet deps).

## How to use

```bash
# Summary counts
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/query_status.py"

# Full task list
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/query_status.py" --detail
```

## Consistency check

The counts above describe progress; for a read-only **integrity** audit run the bundle's queue doctor — `queue_doctor.sh`, in `claude-arsenal/bin/`. It flags orphaned payloads, broken or cyclic dependencies, crashed `in_progress` claims, stale or `branch:`-only `pr` fields, likely secrets committed into payloads, and — when `gh` is available — false-`done` (a `done`/`merged` row whose PR never merged).

```bash
# Audit the queue (auto-enables the gh / git layers when those tools are present)
queue_doctor.sh

# As a CI / make gate: exit non-zero on findings at/above the chosen severity
queue_doctor.sh --fail-on error
```

It never writes. The orchestrator runs it at session start as an advisory report; run it standalone to gate CI or a `make` target. See `claude-arsenal/AGENTS.md` for the session-start wiring.

## Gotchas

- **`in_progress` tasks with no active assignee signal a crashed session.** Use the bundle release script to reset it to `open` status (see `claude-arsenal/AGENTS.md`). The consistency check above flags these as `stranded-in-progress`.
- **`blocked` does not mean failed.** A task becomes eligible automatically once its dependencies complete.
