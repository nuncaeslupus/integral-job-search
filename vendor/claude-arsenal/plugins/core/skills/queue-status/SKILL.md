# queue-status

Reports the board: how many tasks are open, claimed, done and blocked, and — with
`--detail` — every task with its priority, state, and what is holding it up.

CANARY: queue-status-loaded-2026-06-13-fb78d23e-d4e5f6a7b8c9d0e1

## When to load

Load this skill when:

- The user asks "how is the queue?", "what tasks are left?", "queue status", or "/queue-status".
- Checking whether all tasks are done before closing a loop session.
- Diagnosing a stuck queue (tasks blocked on unmet deps).

## How to use

First fetch the `arsenal:task` issues — open **and** closed — with whatever GitHub access
this surface has, and save the JSON. Then:

Run `query_status.py` (in `claude-arsenal/scripts/`, beside `task_select.py`):

```
# Summary counts
query_status.py --issues /tmp/issues.json

# Full task list with blockers
query_status.py --issues /tmp/issues.json --detail
```

It ships in the runtime bundle rather than in this skill's own folder because
the session-start protocol in `AGENTS.md` runs the board every session without
loading any skill — a `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` path would be undefined there.

State comes from the issues and the graph comes from `arsenal/tasks/`, which is exactly
what the selector reads — so the board can never disagree with what a worker will pick up
next. Without `--issues` it still lists the graph, but every task shows as `open`, because
state lives in the issues.

## What it flags

Three problems are reported on stderr, and `--fail-on-problems` turns them into a non-zero
exit so a `make` target or CI job can gate on them:

- **`no-gate`** — the task has no fenced ` ```bash ` block. A gate written as prose executes
  nothing, and a gate that runs nothing passes everything. This is worth failing a build
  over: one consumer audit found 0 of 70 payloads carried a fenced block, so its entire
  gate layer had been inert without anyone noticing.
- **`no-handle`** — the task file exists but no issue points at it, so no agent can claim
  it. Run `handle_sync.py` and create the missing issues. This delays work rather than
  corrupting it.
- **`depends on unknown task`** — a dep id that no task file declares. The selector treats
  unknown deps as unsatisfied, so such a task would never become eligible and would never
  say why.
- **completion drift** — the task file and its issue disagree about whether the work is
  finished: a file archived `status: merged` whose issue is still open (the PR merged
  without closing it), or an issue closed as completed whose task file is still live in
  `tasks/`. Both mean a merge did half of what it was meant to. `effective_state` hides
  this from selection on purpose — a merged task must never be handed out again, whatever
  became of its issue — so the board is the only place it can surface.

## Gotchas

- **`blocked` does not mean failed.** A task becomes eligible automatically once its
  dependencies are closed as completed.
- **Only a close as *completed* satisfies a dependency.** An issue closed as not-planned
  leaves dependents blocked on purpose — a stray close should not release work nobody did.
- **`claimed` means an agent holds the claim ref**, not that a human is looking at it. The
  issue's assignee and its claim comment name which session, and the session id doubles as
  a link to it. A claim held for over a day with no open PR belonged to a session that
  crashed; `.github/workflows/arsenal-queue.yml` releases those on a schedule, so a repo
  with the workflow should not accumulate them.
