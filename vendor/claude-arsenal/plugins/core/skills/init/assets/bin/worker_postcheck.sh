# worker_postcheck.sh
# Run by the orchestrator after EVERY worker returns.
# Restores and asserts the one invariant the coordination protocol depends on:
# HEAD is back on the queue branch and the working tree is clean.
#
# Why: a worker is supposed to run in its own `isolation: worktree`. When that
# isolation is silently unavailable (observed on some web sessions), the worker
# runs in the orchestrator's shared tree instead: open_task_pr.sh checks out a
# feature branch (moving the orchestrator's HEAD off the coordination branch),
# and a gate-failed worker can leave uncommitted edits sitting on the
# orchestrator's own tree. Subsequent steps then run from the wrong branch (it guards on the recorded host
# branch), and a stray `git commit -a` could sweep task code onto the queue
# branch. This script makes the post-worker state safe either way:
#   - In a real worktree the orchestrator's HEAD never moved → cheap no-op that
#     just confirms the invariant (prints `ok`).
#   - In the silent in-place case it discards the worker's residual tree state
#     (its code is already committed+pushed on the feature branch for a `done`,
#     or deliberately abandoned for a gate failure) and returns to the queue
#     branch (prints `restored`).
#
# A `restored` result is the orchestrator's signal that worktree isolation is
# NOT in effect this session: it must clamp ARSENAL_MAX_WORKERS=1 and stay in
# serialized in-place mode for the rest of the loop.
#
# NOTHING IS EVER DISCARDED IRRECOVERABLY. The restore path is a hard reset of
# whatever tree it runs in — including the host's MAIN working tree, which is
# where the orchestrator runs it. Uncommitted work that happens to be sitting
# there (a human's WIP, an orchestrator's own in-progress edit) has no blob in
# the object database and cannot be recovered from the reflog. So every
# destructive path here first snapshots the whole tree — tracked edits AND
# untracked files — to a permanent `refs/arsenal-rescue/…` ref via
# rescue_snapshot.sh, prints that ref on stderr, and appends it to
# `${ARSENAL_SESSION_DIR}/rescue_refs`.
#
# Stdout: `ok` | `restored`. NOTE: `ok` means the tree invariant holds, NOT
#         that worktree isolation is in effect — that verdict is the
#         `worktree_isolation` sentinel, which the selector reads directly.
# Env:    ARSENAL_WORKER_TOPLEVEL — the worker's `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`.
#         Without it isolation cannot be proven and nothing is recorded.
# Stderr: `worker_postcheck: rescued uncommitted changes to <ref> …` when a
#         restore had work to save.
# Exit:   0 invariant holds (possibly after restore); 2 could not restore.

# Persist the isolation verdict for task_select.py (QIC-6).
#
# `restored` is proof of in-place execution: the orchestrator's HEAD had moved,
# so something ran in its tree → `unavailable`, and the next batch is clamped to
# one worker without relying on the orchestrator to remember.
#
# The positive verdict needs real evidence, and "HEAD did not move" is not it.
# A worker can run in the orchestrator's tree without ever moving HEAD: on a
# surface that restricts pushes to the session's designated branch, the branch
# the worker should be on IS the branch the orchestrator is on; and a worker
# that fails before reaching open_task_pr.sh never switches branch either. Both
# leave the invariant intact and used to be recorded as `available` — which is
# what PERMITS ramping to ARSENAL_MAX_WORKERS > 1, so an unproven condition
# licensed the exact parallel-fan-out-into-one-tree it exists to prevent (#147).
#
# So the answer comes from the worker itself: ARSENAL_WORKER_TOPLEVEL carries
# the `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` the worker returns. Different root → it
# genuinely ran elsewhere → `available`. Same root → in-place → `unavailable`,
# whatever the branch did. Absent → nothing is recorded, and `unknown` keeps the
# selector clamped, because the safe reading of unproven is not "proven".
