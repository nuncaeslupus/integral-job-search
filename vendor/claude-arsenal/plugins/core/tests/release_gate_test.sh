#!/usr/bin/env bash
# release_gate_test.sh — integration test for the release-side acceptance-gate
# guard in release.sh (CA-16).
#
# It lives apart from release_test.sh because it needs a different topology:
# the caller's tree on the DEFAULT branch, the ledger in a separate
# coordination worktree (ARSENAL_QUEUE_DIR), and a bare remote — which is
# exactly the shape in which the bug hid. release_test.sh runs the caller
# directly on arsenal-queue, where every payload happens to be on disk and the
# defect is invisible.
#
# What it pins down — `release.sh <id> done` never records `done` having
# silently skipped the gate:
#   - payload on disk → the gate runs; passing records done, failing refuses
#   - payload only on arsenal-queue → resolved via gate_run.sh and run. This is
#     the regression: the orchestrator's tree sits on the default branch, where
#     a payload seeded during the session does not exist, and the old
#     `-f <payload>` precondition skipped the whole gate block there
#   - a gate that CANNOT run (127) → refused, with a message that stays
#     distinguishable from a gate that ran and failed
#   - no payload anywhere → allowed (nothing to enforce), but announced loudly
#     on stdout: silence is the bug, not permissiveness
# Exit: 0 on PASS, 1 on FAIL.
