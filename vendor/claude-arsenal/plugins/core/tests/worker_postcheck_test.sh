# This script runs `git reset --hard` + `git clean -fd` in the host's own tree,
# so its two safety properties are worth pinning precisely:
#
#   1. It restores to the branch the SESSION started on — never a hardcoded
#      `main`. On Claude Code on the web a session is pinned to its own branch,
#      and resetting to `main` would throw away exactly the work it was doing.
#   2. It snapshots a dirty tree to a rescue ref BEFORE destroying anything, so
#      a wrong assumption costs a ref lookup rather than the work.
#
# Exit: 0 on PASS, 1 on FAIL.
