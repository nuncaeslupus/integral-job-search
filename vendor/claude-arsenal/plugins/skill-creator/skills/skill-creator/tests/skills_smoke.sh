#
# Mechanical smoke test for the skill library.
#
# Runs audit_library.py over each discovered plugin's skill library:
#   - plugins/<plugin>/skills/ (auto-discovered)
#
# Each per-library audit invokes validate.py for every skill inside,
# plus library-level checks (overlap, canary uniqueness, listing
# budget, duplicate-group SHAs). Exits non-zero if any library
# reports a blocking issue.
#
# The cross-library aggregate budget is NOT enforced here — that
# check is owned by ship and is invoked with the
# multi-path form of audit_library.py.
#
# Live-session probes (load_prompts / no_load_prompts from each
# skill's evals/loading_verification.json) are a deferred extension
# described in references/validation-and-evals.md; not implemented
# in this harness.
#
# Usage:
#   bash plugins/skill-creator/skills/skill-creator/tests/skills_smoke.sh
#   bash plugins/skill-creator/skills/skill-creator/tests/skills_smoke.sh --severity warn
