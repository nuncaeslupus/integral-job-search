## Automatic session protocol

Every session, without waiting to be asked:

1. Read `arsenal/session/handover.md` for the previous session's context.
2. List the repository's issues labelled `arsenal:task` — **open and closed** — and
   save the JSON. Use whatever GitHub access this surface has; run
   `claude-arsenal/bin/github_channel.sh --detect` to find out which.
3. Run `python3 claude-arsenal/scripts/query_status.py --issues <that file>` for the
   board, and report anything it flags.
4. Pick up work: `python3 claude-arsenal/scripts/task_select.py --issues <that file>`
   returns the next unblocked task, then
   `bash claude-arsenal/bin/claim_task.sh <id>` takes it (see `@claude-arsenal/AGENTS.md`).
   - **Nothing returned + workspace plans exist** → seed tasks from each plan.
   - **Nothing at all** → ask what to work on.
5. Open each task's PR with `Closes #<issue>` so merging it closes the task by itself.
6. After any session with tasks: update `arsenal/session/handover.md`.

## Known environment state

**GitHub Actions is out of runner minutes until the next billing period
(noted 2026-08-19).** Every job on every workflow run fails in 3–5 seconds with
`runner_id: 0` and `runner_name: ""` — no runner is ever assigned. This affects
`main` as much as any branch: run #142 on `ba7c980` (main's own HEAD) failed
identically, while the last green run was #137. It is not caused by any diff.

Do not treat a red CI on this repository as a signal about the code, and do not
push speculative "fixes" for it. Diagnose it once by checking a failed job for
`runner_id: 0` plus a sub-5-second duration; if both hold, it is this.

**Run the gate locally instead** — these are exactly what CI would run, and all
five must pass before a merge:

```bash
make lint           # ruff + strict mypy
make test           # pytest
make evidence       # regenerate every measurement, fail on drift
make verify-subtree # the arsenal bundle matches its subtree
make verify-gates   # every done/merged task can still show its measurement
```

Remove this section once runs are completing with real durations again.
