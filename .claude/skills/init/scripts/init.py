## Automatic session protocol

Every session, without waiting to be asked:

1. Read `{home}/session/handover.md` for the previous session's context.
2. List the repository's issues labelled `arsenal:task` — **open and closed** — and
   save the JSON. Use whatever GitHub access this surface has; run
   `claude-arsenal/bin/github_channel.sh --detect` to find out which. Request
   `number`, `title`, `state`, `labels`, `assignees` and **not `body`** — the bodies
   are the bulk of that fetch and nothing downstream reads them.
3. Run `python3 claude-arsenal/scripts/query_status.py --issues <that file>` for the
   board, and report anything it flags.
4. Pick up work: `python3 claude-arsenal/scripts/task_select.py --issues <that file>`
   returns the next unblocked task, then
   `bash claude-arsenal/bin/claim_task.sh <id>` takes it (see `@claude-arsenal/AGENTS.md`).
   - **Nothing returned + workspace plans exist** → seed tasks from each plan.
   - **Nothing at all** → ask what to work on.
5. Open each task's PR with `Closes #<issue>` so merging it closes the task by itself.
6. After any session with tasks: update `{home}/session/handover.md`.

    Installed by default because the whole point is that queue upkeep does not
    depend on anyone remembering it — a workflow a repo has to opt into is one
    more setup step to forget, and the sessions that most need the cleanup are
    the ones that ended badly. But a file that grants itself write access to
    issues and contents should never appear silently, so the first install
    prints exactly what it will do and what it can touch.

    Deleting the file has to be a real opt-out, and that needs a record: the
    session-start protocol runs `init.py --silent` every session, so a purely
    file-based check would reinstall a workflow the user deliberately removed —
    on every single start, re-granting write access they had revoked and
    dirtying their checkout each time. So the decision lives in
    `arsenal/config.toml`, which an upgrade never overwrites:

      * no key       — never offered here. Install it and record `true`.
      * `true`, file present — refresh/no-op, as for any vendored file.
      * `true`, file gone    — deleted since the install. Record `false`, say so
                               once, and never reinstall.
      * `false`      — opted out. Do nothing, silently. Set the key back to
                       `true` to opt in again.

    A workflow the user has edited is left alone — clobbering local changes on
    every session start is how vendored files lose people's trust.
