"""issue_import.py — turn labelled GitHub issues into queue tasks.

The board knows about issues in one direction: a task file gets an issue handle
(`handle_sync.py`). Nothing goes the other way, so an issue filed between
sessions — from a phone, while noticing something, with no session open to seed
a task — is not work as far as the selector is concerned. It never appears in a
batch, never blocks anything, and never shows up on the board. Because an empty
selection is the signal for "report done or ask the user", a repository can be
reported as having no work while carrying a dozen open issues.

That is the same failure the protocol already names for spec divergences — a
record that lives somewhere the queue does not read is a record that stops
existing — one layer further out.

    issue_import.py --issues /tmp/all-issues.json          # what would be imported
    issue_import.py --issues /tmp/all-issues.json --apply  # write the task files

Four things this deliberately does NOT do:

* **It does not import every issue.** Only issues carrying the import label
  (default `arsenal:queue`). Discussion threads and questions are not work, and
  turning them into claimable tasks means a worker opens a PR against a
  question. Opting in is the conservative direction.
* **It does not make the new task claimable.** A seeded task's gate is the issue
  body, which is prose — and a gate that runs nothing passes everything. So the
  task carries `requires: [human:gate]`, a capability no surface offers, which
  makes the selector skip it until a human writes a real gate and removes the
  line. Visible on the board, not dispatchable.
* **It does not open a second issue.** The imported issue *becomes* the handle:
  the caller adds the printed `arsenal-task: <id>` marker to that issue. Opening
  a fresh one would leave two issues for one task and a board that disagrees
  with itself.
* **It does not touch the network.** Task files are local and written here;
  every remote change is printed for the caller to apply over whatever channel
  the surface has — the `arsenal-task:` marker to append, and the label swap
  that moves the issue onto the board. With no issues to read it does nothing,
  which is how it degrades when GitHub is unreachable.

Exit: 0 (an empty import is an answer), 2 on unreadable input.
