"""handle_sync.py — find task files that have no issue handle yet.

This is the one sync step the design keeps, and it is worth being precise about
why it is not the old `queue_sync.sh` in a new coat. That script reconciled
*state* in both directions between two copies of a ledger, which is where its
conflicts and its path-traversal bug came from. This one is one-directional and
idempotent: a task file exists, so an issue should point at it. Nothing flows
back, and running it twice changes nothing.

If it never runs, work is delayed — a task nobody opened an issue for is simply
not claimable yet — but nothing is corrupted.

    handle_sync.py --tasks-dir arsenal/tasks --issues /tmp/issues.json

Prints one JSON object per missing handle, ready to create with whatever GitHub
channel the surface offers:

    {"task":"t-3f8a91c2","title":"…","labels":["arsenal:task","arsenal-id:t-3f8a91c2"],"body":"…"}

A task whose title is a near-match for an issue that resolved to nothing is
reported on stderr instead of proposed: the board still resolves handles by
title where no `arsenal-id:` label has been stamped yet, so "no id resolved" can
mean the fold missed rather than that no issue exists, and a duplicate handle
corrupts state where a delay does not. When SEVERAL tasks fold to that same
title the guard cannot say which one the issue covers, so they are proposed with
an `"ambiguous"` key naming the collision — a person can weigh it, and the
unattended caller creates nothing.

Exit: 0 when everything has a handle or the missing ones were printed,
2 on unreadable input.
