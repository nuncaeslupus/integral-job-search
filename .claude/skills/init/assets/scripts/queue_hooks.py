"""queue_hooks.py — the queue's state transitions, run by GitHub rather than by a session.

`Closes #<issue>` makes merging a PR close its task, and that covers the happy
path completely. What it does not cover is everything that happens when no
session is running:

* a PR closed **without** merging leaves its issue assigned and labelled
  `arsenal:claimed` — the task is not done, but no selector will ever offer it
  again, so the work silently disappears from the board;
* a task file merged to the default branch has **no issue handle** until someone
  runs `handle_sync.py`, so it is invisible work until the next session does
  chores before it can start;
* a session that crashes mid-task leaves a claim nobody releases;
* a PR opened by hand — no keyword, or a keyword pointing nowhere — merges and
  closes nothing.

Each of those used to be a line in a protocol asking an agent to remember
something at the end of a session, which is the least reliable place to put it:
the sessions that most need cleaning up are exactly the ones that ended badly.
So they run here instead, triggered by GitHub events, whether or not anybody is
watching.

    queue_hooks.py pr-closed      # on: pull_request_target [closed]
    queue_hooks.py sync-handles   # on: push to the default branch, arsenal/tasks/**
    queue_hooks.py sweep-claims   # on: schedule

Deciding and doing are split: every subcommand builds a list of actions from
its inputs with no network at all, then applies them. `--dry-run` prints the
plan as JSON and touches nothing, which is how the behaviour is tested without
a GitHub in the loop.

Exit: 0 when the plan applied (or was printed), 1 when an action failed,
2 on unusable input.
