"""arsenal_timings.py — how long the loop's expensive boundaries actually take.

`usage_report.py` answers what a fleet SPENT; this answers what it WAITED on.
Nothing in the bundle recorded that, so a consumer whose loop felt slow had to
hand-instrument it for a day or give up — and "the gate feels slow" has exactly
one natural response, which is to turn the gate off. The two most actionable
reports this project has had exist only because somebody did that by hand.

Reads the TSV `bin/_timing.sh` appends to (`tmp/arsenal-metrics/metrics.tsv`),
which never leaves the machine: an event name, a caller-chosen label, a
duration and an exit code. Collection is always on and costs milliseconds;
reading is this script, and nothing enters a context window until someone runs
it.

## What it prints, and why in that order

**By event, ordered by total time.** A 90-second step that runs once a day is
not the bottleneck a 9-second one that runs 200 times is, so total is the column
to read first. Then p50 against p95: p50 says what a typical run costs and p95
says what the loop actually feels, because the slow tail is what a person sits
through.

**Rounds per change.** The round count is the multiplier. A review round that
takes four minutes is fine; four of them on one change is most of an hour, and
that is a fact about the change rather than about the reviewer. This is the
number that says which.

Exit: 0 report printed, 1 no data yet (with what to do about it), 2 usage error.
