# State layout and task lifecycle

Read this for a lookup: where a file lives, what a directory is for, or what a
task's state means. Nothing here has to be in context to start a session.

## Task lifecycle

```
open ──claim ref created──→ claimed ──PR merged (Closes #N + archive)──→ done
  ↑                            │
  └──── attempt failed ────────┘   (next attempt claims <id>.a2, up to max-attempts)
```

State is **derived, never stored**: `open` is an open issue with no claim, `claimed` is an
open issue carrying `arsenal:claimed` or an assignee, `done` is an issue closed **as
completed**. An issue closed as not-planned leaves dependents blocked on purpose — a stray
close must not release work that was never done. Because state is derived, a stored status
cannot drift from reality, which is the entire class of bug the old queue doctor existed
to detect.

## Task format — the rest of it

`priority` encodes **task size** — S=10, M=5, L=1, larger runs sooner — and nothing
else. Build order belongs in `deps`. Only `id` and `title` are required.

**Ids are random** (`t-` plus eight hex characters). They used to be a hash of the title
truncated to four characters, checked for uniqueness against the local file only — so two
agents adding a task with the same title minted the same id. Random ids need no
coordination, which is what lets several agents add tasks at once.

## State directory layout

```
claude-arsenal/        ← upstream. /init owns it and may overwrite it freely
  AGENTS.md            ← the session protocol; imported via @claude-arsenal/AGENTS.md
  references/          ← the rest of the protocol, read on demand (never imported)
  agents/worker.md     ← worker subagent definition
  bin/
    github_channel.sh  ← the ONE place that knows how to reach GitHub (gh | rest | none)
    claim_task.sh      ← atomic claim via ref creation
    worktree_probe.sh  ← probes whether git worktrees work here (fan-out safety)
    worker_postcheck.sh ← restores a clean tree after each worker
    rescue_snapshot.sh ← snapshots a dirty tree before any forced restore
    open_task_pr.sh    ← worker-side; branch → commit → push → PR
    gate_run.sh        ← runs the task's fenced gate block
    budget_check.sh    ← quota stop + per-session round cap
    check_update.sh    ← bundle freshness against the upstream tag
    statusline_capture.sh, detect_surface.sh, workspace_list.sh
  workflows/
    arsenal-queue.yml  ← installed to .github/workflows/ by /init
  scripts/
    task_select.py     ← pure selector: graph + issues → the next task
    query_status.py    ← the board (and the drift report: task vs issue disagreeing)
    handle_sync.py     ← task files with no issue handle yet
    issue_import.py    ← the other direction: labelled issues with no task yet
    issue_for_task.py  ← task id → its issue number, so `Closes #N` can be written
    queue_hooks.py     ← the transitions GitHub runs: close, release, sync, sweep
    arsenal_config.py  ← reads arsenal/config.toml
    arsenal_migrate.py ← one-time move from the old coordination-branch queue
    gate_evidence.py

arsenal/               ← yours. Scaffolded once, then never written by an upgrade
  config.toml          ← merge-policy, test-discipline, listing budget…
  tasks/<id>.md        ← the tasks; their front matter is the DAG
  specs/ plans/        ← specifications and plans
  project/             ← workspace overview + per-workspace context
  session/
    handover.md        ← live; updated each session
    surface_profile.json, rate_limits.json, budget_iterations.json  ← gitignored
```

The split is the point: upstream owns exactly one directory, so an upgrade can never touch
your tasks, plans, or settings — and the vendored prefix contains only upstream content,
which is what makes it consumable as a subtree.
