# Queue seeding — turning plans and issues into tasks

Read this when the selector returns nothing and the queue has to be filled: from
a plan table, from issues filed between sessions, or from a divergence found
mid-session. A session that picks up existing work never needs this file.

## Seeding from a plan table

When there are no task files yet and a plan exists, seed the queue from its
implementation-tasks table **without asking the user first**.

Where the plan lives depends on the repo's shape, and that is the only
difference between the two cases:

- **Workspace-structured** — `arsenal/project/overview.md` lists the workspaces;
  read `arsenal/project/<workspace>/plan.md` for each, and pass
  `--workspace <NAME>` on every `create_task.py` call so the task files under the
  right workspace.
- **Solo / single-workspace** — read `status/plan.md` and omit `--workspace`.

Everything below is the same either way. The table columns are:
`T# | Description | Location | Size | Depends | Gate | Tests`

**Steps:**

1. Add tasks with no dependencies first, capturing each printed ID. Pass the
   size from the table's Size column and let `--size` write the value:
   ```bash
   python3 .claude/skills/queue-add/scripts/create_task.py \
     --title "T1: <Description>" \
     --size S \
     --workspace FRONTEND \
   # → prints e.g. t-3f8a91c2, and the issue handle to open on stderr
   ```

   > **Ordering goes in `deps`; size goes in `priority`.** Transcribing an
   > ordered `T1 … T50` table tempts you to encode rank here — T1 gets 100, T2
   > gets 95 — and nothing rejects it. But a rank scale's floor sits above the
   > size scale's ceiling, so once both are on one board every rank-encoded task
   > outranks every sized one unconditionally, and dispatch order comes to
   > reflect when a row was written rather than anything anyone chose. `deps` is
   > the DAG the selector actually runs on and the thing that survives
   > re-planning; use it. `query_status.py` reports a board carrying both.

2. Add tasks whose deps are now in the queue:
   ```bash
   python3 .claude/skills/queue-add/scripts/create_task.py \
     --title "T3: <Description>" \
     --size M \
     --workspace FRONTEND \
     --deps t-3f8a91c2 \
   ```

3. `create_task.py` writes `arsenal/tasks/<id>.md`; fill in its body and replace the
   placeholder gate:

   ```markdown
   # T1: <Description>

   ## Acceptance gate
   <Gate column content — prose describing what must be true.>

   If the check is mechanically runnable, also add a bash block:
   ```bash
   bash tests/my_feature_test.sh
   ```

   ## Tests
   <Tests column content>

   ## Location
   <Location column content>
   ```

   `gate_run.sh` executes that block, and a worker opens no PR when it fails —
   so a task cannot reach `done` on a gate that failed or never ran. **The fence
   is what makes a gate mechanical**, and a numeric threshold needs a committed
   measurement behind it: see `claude-arsenal/references/evidence-gates.md`
   before writing either kind.

4. Proceed to the **worker loop** (`claude-arsenal/references/worker-loop.md`).

## Importing issues filed between sessions

Step 4b of the session-start protocol runs `issue_import.py`. It writes a task
file per labelled issue that is not already a handle, and prints an
`arsenal-task: <id>` line to append to that issue's body — which turns the
existing issue into the task's handle rather than opening a second one. Apply
those, and commit the new task files.

Why the step exists: issues get filed between sessions, from a phone, with no
session open to seed a task, and until it existed nothing read them. The
selector sees only task files, so an empty selection was reported as "no work"
in a repo carrying a dozen open issues.

An imported task carries `requires: [human:gate]` and is therefore **visible but
never dispatched** — its gate is the issue's prose, and a gate that runs nothing
passes everything. Writing a real gate and deleting that line is what makes it
claimable, which is a human's call, not a worker's.

The import label defaults to `arsenal:queue`; set `import-label` in
`arsenal/config.toml` to change it.

## Divergence handling

A **spec divergence** is code that contradicts what `spec.md` / `plan.md`
require — wrong labels, wrong scope, a missing step, a wrong constant. Noting one
in `handover.md` prose is **insufficient**: the handover is a snapshot the next
session overwrites, so a prose-only divergence never shows up in `queue-status`,
is never ordered or blocked against other tasks, and silently persists across
context compactions while workers keep building on the wrong inputs.

**Rule: any blocking spec divergence found during a session MUST be seeded as a
queue task before the session ends.** The queue is the source of truth, not the
handover.

Minimum task — title it `D-N` (the Nth divergence this session):

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/queue-add/scripts/create_task.py \
  --title "D-N: <short description>" \
```

In a workspace-structured project, add `--workspace <WORKSPACE>` to file the
divergence under the right workspace; solo / single-workspace repos omit it.
Give it a task file at `arsenal/tasks/<id>.md` that names three things:
what the spec requires, what the code does, and the fix location.

This applies to workers and solo sessions alike. A worker that spots a divergence
outside its own task's scope flags it in its returned outcome; the orchestrator —
the single queue writer — seeds the task (it never lets a worker push to the
coordination branch). A solo session seeds the task directly.
