# rebase_stack.sh [--no-push] <branch> <old-base>
# Rebase a stacked branch onto the current origin/main after its parent PR
# has been squash-merged. Replays only the commits between <old-base>
# (exclusive) and <branch> (inclusive) — skipping the already-merged parent
# commits — then force-pushes with lease.
#
# Usage (after fix/iss-A merges into main):
#   bin/rebase_stack.sh fix/iss-B fix/iss-A
#
# <branch>   — the stacked branch to rebase (defaults to current branch)
# <old-base> — the tip of the parent branch at the time <branch> was cut
#              (a branch name, tag, or commit SHA)
# --no-push  — rebase only; skip the pre-push gate and the force-push
#
# Evidence conflicts resolve themselves. A repo that uses evidence gates
# commits a measurement of its own tree (`evidence:` in a task's gate block),
# so every branch touches those files and every replay onto a moved base
# conflicts on them. Hand-merging two of them is meaningless — the right answer
# is neither side, it is whatever the code measures on the resulting tree. So
# when the conflicted set is a SUBSET of the declared evidence paths, this takes
# the branch's side, re-runs the host gate to regenerate, and continues.
# Anything outside that set stops the rebase and is reported: that is a real
# conflict and a human's to resolve. The subset test is what makes the
# auto-resolve safe to run without thinking about it.
