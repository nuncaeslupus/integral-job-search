# - plugins/core/skills/init/assets/bin/gate_target.py
# Shipped in the core bundle because plugin hooks do not travel with vendored
# skills, and vendoring is the only path a cloud session can use. Keep both
# copies in sync. Update via skill-workshop's sync_duplicates.py.
"""gate_target.py — decide what a tool call is about to write inside a skill folder.

Reads a PreToolUse payload on stdin, prints the skill-folder path the call would
modify, or nothing when it would not modify one.

Edit / Write / MultiEdit name their target outright. Bash does not: `sed -i`,
`tee`, a heredoc redirect and a Python one-liner all reach a SKILL.md without
ever appearing as a `file_path`, which is how the gate came to be bypassable by
the edit style the harness encourages.

For Bash the command is tokenised and each simple command is asked where it
*writes*, which is not the same as which paths it mentions. `cp SKILL /tmp/bak`
only reads the skill; `cp /tmp/x SKILL` overwrites it. Getting that distinction
wrong is costly in both directions — a gate that misses a write is no gate, and
one that blocks reads gets routed around instead of through.

Known limits: a path built from a shell variable (`cp "$SKILL" …`) is opaque
here, and so is one assembled at runtime. This raises the cost of an accidental
bypass; it is not a sandbox.
