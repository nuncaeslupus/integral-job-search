#!/usr/bin/env bash
# host_setup.sh — run the host repo's install/bootstrap command in this tree.
#
# `isolation: worktree` gives every worker a clean checkout, and a checkout
# carries tracked files only: no `node_modules/`, no `.venv/`, nothing an
# install step produces. So the first gate a worker runs dies on a missing tool
# that has nothing to do with the change under test, and the worker spends a
# full gate run — 10-12 minutes in the fan-out that prompted this — diagnosing a
# fact that is invariant for the repo. Measured once at nine workers: five of
# them rediscovered it independently.
#
# The command comes from `host-setup` in arsenal/config.toml, the sibling of
# `host-gate`, so the repo says `npm ci && uv sync` once in the place the rest
# of its gate configuration already lives instead of every worker inferring it.
# Empty by default: a repo that declares nothing is unaffected and this is a
# no-op.
#
# It also reverts what the install writes into TRACKED files — the
# `package-lock.json` churn an `npm install` produces, a re-pinned `uv.lock`.
# Two of those nine workers committed that churn into their task PR, because
# nothing told them not to. The diff has to stay the task's, and asking every
# worker to remember an extra `git checkout --` is how it stops happening.
#
# The contract is on the install's writes, not on a set of paths: whatever the
# install wrote into a tracked file is undone, and whatever the caller had
# already written is still there afterwards — including in the case where those
# are the same file, which is the one where getting it wrong loses work.
#
# SECURITY: host-setup runs verbatim, like host-gate and like a payload's gate
# block. It comes from arsenal/config.toml, which is host-owned and reviewed
# like any other file in the repo — but it is code, not data.
#
# Exit: 0 the command ran and succeeded, or no host-setup is declared
#       1 the command failed — the tree is not set up, and a gate failure after
#         this one may still be environmental. The revert below still runs: a
#         half-finished install is exactly when the tree needs putting back.
#       2 setup error: not a git repository, or config.toml could not be read
#         (a malformed config must not read as "no setup declared")
