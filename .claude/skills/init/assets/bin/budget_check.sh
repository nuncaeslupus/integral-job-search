# budget_check.sh — pre-dispatch quota guard for the worker loop.
#
# Reads arsenal/session/rate_limits.json (written by statusline_capture.sh)
# and decides whether the loop may dispatch more workers.
#
# Exit:
#   3 — a window reports a REFUSAL (`status` present and not "allowed"), OR
#       either window's used_percentage is at/above ARSENAL_QUOTA_STOP_PCT
#       (default 90), OR this session has dispatched ARSENAL_MAX_ITERATIONS
#       rounds (default 50). Loud and distinct so the loop STOPS and writes a
#       handover.
#   0 — under threshold, OR data is missing/unparseable/absent fields. The
#       missing-data case is a deliberate FAIL-OPEN for the QUOTA check only:
#       the loop keeps running where quota is not observable (API/metered usage,
#       non-Pro/Max plan, before the first response, or older Claude Code).
#
# A REFUSAL IS NOT A PERCENTAGE. `status` and `used_percentage` answer different
# questions and are checked separately, on purpose. A percentage is a forecast:
# 88% means the next call will probably work, and the threshold is a judgement
# about how much headroom a fleet should keep. `status: "rejected"` is a fact
# already established about a call that was made — the next one fails now,
# whatever any percentage says, and no threshold setting should be able to talk
# the loop past it. So the refusal check runs FIRST and ignores
# ARSENAL_QUOTA_STOP_PCT entirely; mapping one onto the other (a refusal
# synthesised as "100%") would let ARSENAL_QUOTA_STOP_PCT=101 disable it.
#
# It also reaches a surface the percentage cannot. `get_session` on a cloud
# session returns `rate_limit_info` with `status` and no `used_percentage`, so a
# document carrying only what that surface can supply used to hit the
# "no used_percentage" fail-open and guard nothing. Any value other than
# "allowed" stops — including `null`, `false` and a number: the field's vocabulary
# names the permitting value, and anything else, malformed or merely unfamiliar,
# is not a permission to continue. The check is keyed on the KEY being present,
# never on the value being well-formed. That direction
# is deliberate — the field is written only by a host that chose to write it, so
# an unrecognised value is a misconfiguration worth halting loudly over rather
# than a guard that quietly does nothing.
#
# rate_limits.json is Pro/Max-only, so on API/metered billing the quota guard
# always fails open. The per-session dispatch-round cap is the ALWAYS-AVAILABLE
# backstop: it does not depend on observable quota, so an auto-dispatching loop
# can never run unbounded. Set ARSENAL_MAX_ITERATIONS=0 to disable it (quota-only
# behaviour). The counter resets per session, keyed on
# CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE_SESSION_ID falling back to CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID — the
# same pair claiming-internals.md names. The old CLAUDE_SESSION_ID is set on no
# current surface, so every run keyed on the literal "default": one shared
# counter across every session on the machine, which both over-counts a fresh
# session and lets a long one reset by coincidence.
#
# Both guards above are PER SESSION. Nothing above them says how many other
# sessions are dispatching against the same account-wide window right now — the
# gap that let nine concurrent orchestrators each see a compliant per-session
# budget and share one five-hour window between them. There is no API for "how
# many sessions are live"; what exists is `~/.claude/projects/<project>/<session
# id>.jsonl`, one transcript file per top-level session, written continuously
# while that session runs. So this is a REPORT, not a gate: every call lists
# sibling transcript files modified in the last ARSENAL_CONCURRENCY_WINDOW_MIN
# minutes (default 15; 0 disables) and prints how many belong to a session id
# other than this one. It cannot tell a live session from one that went idle
# inside the window, it never changes the exit code, and on a cloud surface —
# where each session's container is its own filesystem — it always finds zero,
# silently, because there is nothing to compare against. Where it earns its keep
# is the surface the incident actually happened on: several CLI sessions sharing
# one `~/.claude/projects/`.
