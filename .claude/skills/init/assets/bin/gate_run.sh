# gate_run.sh <task_id>
# Runs the mechanical acceptance gate for a task, if one is defined.
#
# Reads arsenal/tasks/<task_id>.md — falling back to `git show <ref>:…` when the
# file is not on disk, so a caller whose tree predates the commit that added the
# task (a worker on an older base) never has to materialize one —
# and looks for the first ```bash (or ```sh) code block inside the
# ## Acceptance gate section. If found, executes it in the repo root; if absent
# (prose-only gate), nothing is executed.
#
# A GATE THAT RAN NOTHING IS NOT A PASS, and it no longer looks like one. The
# no-block case used to exit 0 in silence, indistinguishable from a real pass —
# and since a worker opens no PR when this script fails,
# a repo whose payloads all write gates as prose (or as inline single-backtick
# commands, which the fence regex does not match) had an inert gate layer for
# every task without a word of warning. One consumer audit found 0 of 70
# payloads carrying a fenced block. Every outcome is now announced on stdout as
# a `gate:` line and, when nothing ran, warned about on stderr:
#
#   gate: passed      a block was found and it exited 0
#   gate: unmeasured  the evidence file declares the metric unmeasured (exit 3)
#   gate: prose-only  an ## Acceptance gate section exists with no fenced block
#   gate: none        no ## Acceptance gate section at all
#
# Set ARSENAL_GATE_REQUIRE_BLOCK=1 to make the two nothing-ran outcomes a hard
# failure (exit 1) — the right setting for a repo that intends every task to
# carry a mechanical gate.
#
# SECURITY: the gate block runs VERBATIM in the caller's working tree — it is
# code, not data. A plan/payload an attacker can influence is therefore
# RCE-from-data; review gate blocks before running. To limit the blast radius
# the gate runs under a throwaway HOME and a PATH stripped of $HOME-local shims
# by default, so $HOME-keyed secrets (~/.ssh, ~/.aws, ~/.netrc, ~/.config/gh)
# and user-writable shim dirs are out of reach — except the directories holding
# the package manager / language runtime (pnpm, npm, node, uv, cargo …), which
# are re-admitted because they are commonly $HOME-installed and without them
# every `pnpm …` gate dies with exit 127 instead of running. This is NOT a
# sandbox. Set ARSENAL_GATE_INHERIT_ENV=1 to run with the caller's full
# environment for gates that genuinely need the real HOME (build caches,
# credentials).
#
# Exit: 0 gate passed, or nothing mechanical was defined (see the `gate:` line)
#       1 gate failed (command exited non-zero), or nothing ran under
#         ARSENAL_GATE_REQUIRE_BLOCK=1
#       2 usage/setup error — including "no task file on disk NOR on any
#         known ref", i.e. there is nothing to read a gate from
#       3 gate COULD NOT RUN (command/interpreter not found, 126/127). Distinct
#         from 1 so "the gate never executed" is never mistaken for a verdict.
#         Also printed loudly on stdout, so a caller that pipes this script's
#         output (`gate_run.sh <id> | tail`) — and thereby loses the exit status
#         to the pipeline — still sees that nothing was verified.
