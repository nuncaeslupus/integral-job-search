"""Record a HAR from a URL, for a session with nobody sitting at the browser.

The rest of this toolkit reads captures and says that making one is the
browser's job. That is the right split when a person is at the keyboard. In an
agent session nobody is, so the skill's first step was a step it could not take
and every consumer wrote the same twenty lines before reaching any of it.

Run it through `uv`, which keeps playwright out of the plugin's install:

    uv run --with playwright python3 capture_har.py --url https://example.com \\
        --output capture.har

Four things here are load-bearing, and each of them costs a run to rediscover:

* **`context.close()` is what writes the file.** If navigation raises and the
  exception escapes, there is no HAR at all — so a site slow or hostile enough
  to be worth capturing is exactly the one that produces nothing. It is in a
  `finally`, and a timed-out navigation still yields whatever was recorded.
* **`channel="chrome"` uses the browser already installed**, so no
  `playwright install` step and no 150 MB download. `--browser chromium` falls
  back to playwright's own build when there is no system Chrome, and
  `--executable PATH` launches a provisioned binary directly — which is what a
  sandbox that ships a browser whose build number this playwright does not
  recognise needs.
* **A fresh context every run** is the point, not an incidental: no cookies, no
  logins, nothing of the operator's session in a file that is routinely
  attached to a bug report.
* **`record_har_content="embed"` stores bodies already decoded while keeping
  the original `content-encoding` header.** `_harlib._decompress` handles that
  shape — bytes that fail their declared codec but read as text are taken as
  decoded — which is what makes a capture from here readable by the scripts
  beside it. Nothing else in the toolkit assumes it.

Playwright is imported inside `main`, not at module scope: every other script
here is stdlib-only so the skill runs in a vendored repo with no dependency
step, and `--help` must answer under the same interpreter.
