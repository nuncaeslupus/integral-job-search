# queue-next

Picks the next unblocked task from the repository's task graph, claims it so no
other agent takes it, and runs the worker loop — optionally scoped by tags, a
workspace, a capability or a fuzzy title.

CANARY: queue-next-loaded-2026-06-13-fb78d23e-b2c3d4e5f6a7b8c9

## When to load

- The user types `/queue-next`, "continue", "resume", "run the workers", or
  `WORKSPACE: Continue` (equivalent to `/queue-next WORKSPACE`).
- A session needs to pick up where a previous one left off.

## The loop

**1. Fetch the task issues.** List issues labelled `arsenal:task`, open and
closed — a closed-as-completed issue is what satisfies a dependency. Request
`number`, `title`, `state`, `labels`, `assignees`, plus `state_reason` where the
surface returns it, and leave out `body`: the resolver matches titles when bodies
are absent, and bodies are most of the fetch. Without `state_reason`, a closed
issue reads as done unless it carries `arsenal:cancelled`. `github_channel.sh --detect` (in `claude-arsenal/bin/`) prints `gh`,
`rest` or `none`; on `none`, use the built-in GitHub tools, because skipping the
fetch means picking up work another agent already holds.

**2. Ask for the next task.** One call, one line of output:

```bash
task_select.py --tasks-dir arsenal/tasks --issues /tmp/issues.json \
               --capability surface:cli --workspace FRONTEND --tag DOCS
```

`task_select.py` (in `claude-arsenal/scripts/`) applies deps, priority,
capabilities and scope. Pass one `--capability` per entry in
`arsenal/session/surface_profile.json`, plus `access:browser` when a browser
appears in this session's own tools — the probe sees the machine, not the
session's connectors. `gate: false` in its output means the task has no runnable
gate; fix the task file before working it, since a prose gate checks nothing.

**3. Check nobody else holds it.** Read the task's issue and skip it if it is
closed, assigned, or labelled `arsenal:claimed`.

**4. Claim it** with `claim_task.sh <task-id>` (in `claude-arsenal/bin/`):

- `won <ref>` → claimed.
- `lost` → another agent got there first; take the next task.
- `manual POST <path> <body>` → make that exact call with the built-in GitHub
  tools. 201 means won, 422 means lost.
- `error:` → misconfiguration; stop and tell the user.

Then self-assign the issue, add `arsenal:claimed`, and comment with the session
id from `CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE_SESSION_ID` (or `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` locally).
When neither is set, say so in the comment rather than writing an id, because a
made-up id points the next reader at a session that does not exist.

Load `references/claim-gotchas.md` when a claim is refused, looks stale, or a
task needs a retry attempt. In short: `lost` is final, stale claims are released
only by `queue_hooks.py sweep-claims`, and a retry needs
`ARSENAL_CLAIM_STALE_OK=1` once the first attempt is known stale.

**5. Work the task, then open its PR with `open_task_pr.sh`.** It writes
`Closes #<issue>` into the PR body and the commit message and moves the task
file into `arsenal/tasks/_history/` in the same diff, so merging closes the
issue, archives the task and unblocks dependents in one step.

**6. Loop back to step 2.**

## Scoping

Bare-word tokens are order-independent and resolved by membership, in this
order; a task qualifies only if it satisfies every token:

| the token matches | it resolves to |
|---|---|
| the suffix of a known capability | `--capability` filter (`HUMAN` → `access:human`, `CLI` → `surface:cli`) |
| a known workspace | `--workspace` filter (at most one) |
| a known tag | `--tag` filter (several are ANDed) |
| nothing above | fuzzy title search |

If two capability classes share a suffix, write the token in full as
`class:value`.

A capability token always filters; it also grants the capability only where
nothing can check it:

| token names | granted by the token? | because |
|---|---|---|
| `surface:*`, `services:*` | no — the probe decides | a cloud session cannot run work that needs a real terminal |
| `access:browser` | no — the session's tools decide | with no browser connected, say so and stop |
| `access:human`, `access:secrets`, `access:device` | yes | nothing can probe them, so the person typing the token is the evidence |

## Gotchas

- **Task files are read from the default branch**, so every agent computes the
  same graph; a task on an unmerged branch is not in the queue yet.
- **A task with no issue handle is invisible.** `arsenal-queue.yml` opens
  handles automatically where installed; otherwise run `handle_sync.py` (in
  `claude-arsenal/scripts/`) and create the ones it lists.
- **Empty scoped selection**: if the global queue still has tasks, report what
  blocks the scope and offer to fall back to the global queue.
